Hi,

Some feedbacks inlined below.

Moreover some generic comments of mine hereafter.
First of all I agree with a previous comment from Arnd that a FS aware of virtual page / erase block is much better than using contexts especially if this requires low effort by re-using similar concepts as in the scsi stripe example.

My opinion on contexts is:
- A wrong context (context used not in the expected way) can cause much impact on performances than not using it at all
- Fewer contexts are better: eMMC have limited resources. You can expect performance benefit when opening few (3~4) contexts but opening many contexts can be critical.

You can imagine an eMMC like an Observer who tries to dispatch contents based on what "he perceives" as the traffic flow (how much sequential is this data? How much randomic? How much likely is it to be rewritten? etc). ContextIDs are the attempt to move part of the burden from the internal observer to an external observer called FileSystem. 
Given the story above, to give their best I strongly agree that having an open discussion on how to best dispatch the burden between internal and external observer is key to the success of this feature.

Cheers,
   Luca

I agree. Also you can open the large unit context in read/write mode so that you don't need to close the context if you just want to read while writing.

Again I would suggest not to use context unless absolutely sure that the context will be used in the right way.
With the latter, I am not worried about the closing cost but more on the performance impact.

I would expect even larger numbers than 32KB.

That's an interesting question. 
The short answer is that unless we define a use case, it is hard for me to give you meaningful numbers.

One comment here, large unit contexts (according to spec) are not bounded to erase blocks. They can span one or more blocks, actually they are not related to block size at all (just virtual page size of the device which can be read from the EXT_CSD configuration registers for eMMC).
