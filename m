right.

I believe it should only require flushing that one context, although
a specific hardware implementation might be worse than that. Maybe
Luca or Alex can comment on this.

Yes, makes sense. This is probably required to ensure that the data
has made to the drive, at least for the large contexts, but it is
definitely required for housekeeping of contexts if we manage them
from the block layer.
