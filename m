When you write "block group size" do you mean the ext4 block group?  Then yes it would help.  You could also consider setting the flex_bg size to a multiple of this, so that the bitmap blocks are grouped as a multiple of this size.  However, they may not be aligned correctly, which needs extra effort that isn't obvious.  

I think it would be nice to have mke2fs take the stripe_width and/or flex_bg factor into account when sizing/aligning the bitmaps, but it doesn't yet.

It does (or is supposed to), but that isn't code that is exercised very much (most installations use a power-of-two size).

Cheers, Andreas
