Hi Jan,

How do you define slow storage? The proposal at the start of this thread 
was to make BFQ the default for all block devices that create a single 
hardware queue. That includes all SATA storage since scsi-mq only 
creates a single hardware queue when using the SATA protocol. The 
proposal to make BFQ the default for systems with a single hard disk 
probably makes sense but I am not sure that making BFQ the default for 
systems equipped with one or more (SATA) SSDs is also a good idea. 
Especially for multi-socket systems since BFQ reintroduces a queue-wide 
lock. As you know no queue-wide locking happens during I/O in the 
scsi-mq core nor in the blk-mq core.

Bart.
