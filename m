Greetings,

My name is Dr. Innocent Bariate Barikor, Director-General of the=20
National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement=20
Agency Nigeria - (NESREA).

As part of my official responsibilities, I monitor environmental=20
compliance and pollution associated with oil and gas exploration,=20
drilling, and production activities in the Niger Delta and=20
submits relevant findings to the Presidency.

In the course of carrying out these responsibilities, my=20
investigations identified significant environmental compliance=20
concerns involving four major oil-producing companies:

1.      Shell Petroleum Development Company Limited

2.      Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited / Esso Exploration &=20
Production Nigeria Limited

3.      Chevron Nigeria Limited / Texaco Overseas

4.      Elf Petroleum Limited / Total Exploration Limited.

The four companies were subsequently assessed penalties of=20
US$1.2Billion, with the applicable sanctions providing for the=20
potential revocation of their operating licenses in the event of=20
non-compliance. Given the importance of their operating licenses=20
to their continued activities in Nigeria, the four companies=20
appealed for a reduction or waiver of the assessed penalties.=20
Their requests were subsequently considered by the Federal=20
Government, and the applicable fines were reduced to US$800=20
Million.

The companies have since settled the revised penalties with the=20
Ministry of Environment. They have also indicated their intention=20
to provide a US$50,000,000.00 payment in recognition of my role=20
in the process. However, as a senior public official, I am=20
subject to the applicable Code of Conduct and therefore cannot=20
maintain or operate a foreign bank account for the receipt of=20
such funds. Consequently, I am unable to provide a foreign=20
account for this purpose. In view of the foregoing, I am unable=20
to personally receive or facilitate the transfer of any such=20
payment because of the restrictions applicable to my position as=20
a public official.

I therefore seek your assistance in identifying a resourceful and=20
transparent mechanism through which the matter in relation to the=20
gratification can be addressed without any traces to me=20
considering the fact that I am still in active service. Any=20
proposed arrangement should be properly documented and, where=20
required, discussed with a financial facilitator locally without=20
mentioning names; so that all parties are adequately protected=20
and the transaction is handled through the proper channels.

I would appreciate your guidance and cooperation in resolving=20
this matter in a manner that is fully compliant with existing=20
financial regulations.

Best regards,

Dr. Innocent Bariate Barikor
Director General
NESREA.
