[1]:
If no DMA involved, the host drivers usually use memcpy or readl/writel
to transfer the data between MMIO address and buffer coming from the
caller. So, is it also not guaranteed when using memcpy or readl to
transfer data between MMIO address and vmalloc/heap buffer?

If that is the fact, so what I am concerned mostly is that by
seraching the APIs, sdio_writeb and sdio_readb, under the drivers/net
/wireless/, I could see almost all sdio based WLAN drivers passed in
a vmalloc area(actually when built as moudle, it should be located in
MODULE range which also be included as vmalloc area, no?) or heap
buffer.

I assume my question[1] above is fine, then thanks to none of the mmc
host drivers use DMA for sdio_writeb and sdio_readb since it only
request one byte which didn't be fetched from host FIFO and the host
controller HW didn't support this kind of request to use DMA(but may be
not in the future). Otherwise, it may result in scribbling over some
random part of kernel memory.

Actually we didn't see that issues before, so I think the actual
question should be if the buffer from heap or vmalloc will be used with 
DMA involved?

So it's really more dangerous that we were/are taking risking of
scribbling over some memory belonging to other code even if using
PIO if it also not guaranteed to use heap/vmalloc buffer..
