The vendor optimization always splits accesses under 12k, even if they
are aligned. There are (still) some outstanding questions
on how that's supposed to work (to improve anything), but that's the al=
gorithm.

"our" optimization, suggested on this list, was to align accesses onto
flash page size, thus splitting each request into (small) unaligned
and aligned portions.

Yes, absolutely.

In the context of looking at this anyway, I will try and get
comparison data for sqlite on different fs (and different fs tunables)
on flash.

I was surprised too.

I've done tests across reboots that showed consistent results.
Additionally, repeating a test after another showed same results. At
least on this flash medium, block erase (used erase utility from
flashbench, modified to erase everything if no argument provided)
prior to formatting with fs prior to every test seemed to make results
consistent.

Ok. Sounds good. Back to reliable writes it is, so I can roll up the
second quirk...
