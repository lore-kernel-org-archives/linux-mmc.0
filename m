We need a few erase blocks, spaced apart by a few erase blocks each.
Since we don't have to detect the number of erase blocks that the
device can handle, a small number would be ok I guess, so in order
to detect an 8 MB erase block correctly, we might use 3 erase blocks
that are spaced apart by 5 erase blocks, for a total of 104MB.

Once we figure out the erase block size, it would also help to
verify that we can write to at least e.g. 5 blocks concurrently
without triggering garbage collection, so we can print a warning
if it doesn't.
