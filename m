This moves the asynchronous post-processing of a request over
to the finalization function.

The patch has a slight semantic change:

Both places will be in the code path for if (host->areq) and
in the same sequence, but before this patch, the next request
was started before performing post-processing.

The effect is that whereas before, the post- and preprocessing
happened after starting the next request, now the preprocessing
will happen after the request is done and before the next has
started which would cut half of the pre/post optimizations out.

The idea is to later move the finalization to a worker started
by mmc_request_done() and introduce a completion where the code
now has a TODO comment so that we can push in a new request
as soon as the host has completed the previous one.
