Yes that goes away with my MQ patches (not yet rebased)
by stopping to try to look when the queue is empty and just
issue requests asynchronously. I just wanted to point this out,
that counter is kind of fragile and scary to me.

This comment is wrong, just a development artifact I will just delete it.

OK

Same as the first comment. It is fragile and I don't like it,
with asynchronous issueing in MQ this goes away.
