... and a big part of that is knowing what is the downside if we give
incorrect information to the device.  And what are the exact
implications of what it means to group a set of blocks into a
"context".

If it is fundamentally a promise that blocks in a context will be
overwritten or trimmed at the same time then is it counterproductive
to group blocks for overwrite-in-place database where the lifetimes of
the block are extremely different?  Is that giving "wrong" information
going to significantly increase the write amplification factor? 

It may be that the standard doesn't actually answer these questions
and even worse, SSD manufactures may be stupidly trying to keep this
stuff as a "trade securet" --- but we do need to know in order to
optimize performance on real hardware....
