If the CQE implementation depends on MQ, should this not
also select MMC_MQ_DEFAULT?

And if the CQE implementation depens on MQ, isn't it dangerous
to even have a boot option to disable it?

Again I push the point that things are easier to keep in line
if we just support one block request path (MQ), sorry for
hammering.

Why would the CQE case require special suspend/resume
functionality?

This seems two much like on the side CQE-silo engineering,
just use the device .[runtime]_suspend/resume callbacks like
everyone else, make it possible for the host to figure out
if it is in CQE mode or not (I guess it should know already
since cqhci .enable() has been called?) and handle it
from there.

Why would CQE hosts need special accessors and the rest
of the host not need it?

This seems to be a bit hackish "just for CQE" approach,
abstract callbacks like ->dumpregs(), ->write_l() and
->read_l() seems to be something that should be in the
generic struct mmc_host_ops and not tied to CQE, if
needed at all.

->enable and ->disable() for just CQE seem reasonable.
But that leaves just two new ops.

So why not just put .cqe_enable() and .cqe_disable()
ops into mmc_host_ops as optional and be done with it?

This seems overall too much bolted on the side.

I think the above approach to put any CQE-specific callbacks
directly into the struct mmc_host_ops is way more viable.

If special CQE init is needed, why a special cqhci_init()
call? And cqhci_pltfm_init()? It's confusing. Can't
you just call this by default from the core if the host is
CQE capable? Ass a .cqhci_init() callback into mmc_host_ops
if need be.

cqhci_irq() seems necessary though, I see something like this is
probably necessary.
