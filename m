It's OK we need to build consensus.

Yes as far as I can tell.

But you may have to tell me, because I'm not an expert in CMDQ.

Multiple queues are for when you can issue different request truly parallel
without taking any previous and later request into account. CMDQ on
MMC seems to require rollback etc if any of the issued requests after
a certain request fail, and then it is essentially one queue, like a pipeline,
and if one request fails all requests after that request needs to be backed
out, correct?

Depends on the above.

Each queue must have its own error handling, and work isolated from
the other queues to be considered a real hardware queue.

If the requests have dependencies, like referring each other, or
as pointed out, needing to be cancelled if there is an error on a totally
different request, it is just a deep pipeline, single hardware queue.

On the contrary we expect a performance regression as mq has no
scheduling. MQ is created for the usecase where you have multiple
hardware queues and they are so hungry for work that you have a problem
feeding them all. Needless to say, on eMMC/SD we don't have that problem
right now atleast.

The tentative plan as I see it is to shunt in BFQ as the default scheduler
for MQ in the single-hw-queue case. The old block layer schedulers getting
deprecated in the process. But this is really up to the block layer developers.

No it is a venture into the unknown to go where no man has gone before.

I just have a good feeling about this and confidence that it will work out.

So I am doing RFD patches like this one to see if I'm right.
