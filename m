Yes, that sounds like a useful thing to do. It just means that we
have to throw away and redo all the patches, but I think that's ok.

Really? I actually had expected this to be a major issue, to the
point that I thought we would only ever do large contexts in
special emmc-optimized file sytems.

I don't think so. Opening a context should basically be free, and
while closing a context can take some time, my understanding is
that in a sensible implementation that time would never be more
than the time we saved in the first place by using the context:
With a write-only context, the device does not actually have to
write all the data (it may have to write some of it, depending
on the exact mode the context is put into) until the context gets
closed, so it can take advantage of smarter allocation and batched
writes at close time.

I am not aware of any actual SSD technology that would take advantage
of it, but at least the upcoming UFS standard that is supposed to
replace eMMC should do it, and it's somewhere inbetween an eMMC and
an SSD in many ways.
