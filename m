I was aware of REQ_META, but I didn't know there was any benefit to using it. I think it would be easy to set REQ_META on all ext4 metadata if there was a reason to do so.

A context can be seen as an active session, configured for a specific read/write pattern (e.g. sequential in some granularity). Multiple read or write commands are associated with this context to create some logical association between them, to allow device to optimize performance.'

A simple way to do this would be to use the inode number as the context, so writes to the same inode are grouped together. Another possibility is the PID, though that is less clearly correct (e.g. if tar is extracting a buch of files, are they all related or not).
