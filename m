Yes, I have been working on some changes that allow us to tag bios and
pass the information out to storage. These patches have been on the back
burner for a while due to other commitments. But I'll dig them out and
post them later. We just discussed them a couple of weeks ago at the
Linux Storage Workshop.

In the meantime: Can you point me to the relevant eMMC stuff so I can
see how many tiers or classes we have to work with there?
