It is named "tag" because it is the block layer tag.

The block layer tag is a unique number to identify the task to the hardware
queue.  It is typically a number from 0 up to queue depth - 1.

The eMMC specification calls it "task id" but the block layer calls it
"tag".  I went with "tag" to be easier for block layer people to understand.
