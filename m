??? we need to do that anyway and the ones which should go through are
much smaller than the ones which shouldn't go through.

Well, it's convenient to use incorrectly.  If you look at most of
freezable kthreads, they're sadly broken.  I mean, a lot of kthread
users don't even get kthread_should_stop() right.  With freezable()
thrown into the mix, it seems hopeless.  With wq, it's better as
freezing is handled by wq proper.  Even then, I don't know.  It just
seems to lead people to think "ooh, I marked it freezable so I don't
have to think about synchronization across PM events.  Freezer will
magically solve this for me!".  :(

Thanks.
