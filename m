Hi

Here is V7 of the hardware command queue patches without the software
command queue patches, now using blk-mq.

HW CMDQ offers 25% - 50% better random multi-threaded I/O.  I see a slight
2% drop in sequential read speed but no change to sequential write.


Changes since V6:
      mmc: core: Introduce host claiming by context
	New patch.
      mmc: core: Move mmc_start_areq() declaration
	Dropped because it has been applied

	Move recovery_notifier() callback to struct mmc_request
      mmc: core: Add support for handling CQE requests
	Roll __mmc_cqe_request_done() into mmc_cqe_request_done()
	Move function declarations requested by Ulf
      mmc: core: Remove unused MMC_CAP2_PACKED_CMD
	Dropped because it has been applied
      mmc: block: Add CQE support
	Add explanation to commit message
	Adjustment for changed recovery_notifier() callback
      mmc: cqhci: support for command queue enabled host
	Adjustment for changed recovery_notifier() callback
      mmc: sdhci-pci: Add CQHCI support for Intel GLK

Changes since V4:
      mmc: core: Add mmc_retune_hold_now()
	Add explanation to commit message.
      mmc: host: Add CQE interface
	Add comments to callback declarations.

      mmc: block: Use local variables in mmc_blk_data_prep()
	New patch.
      mmc: block: Prepare CQE data
	Adjust due to "mmc: block: Use local variables in mmc_blk_data_prep()"
	Remove priority setting.
	Add explanation to commit message.
      mmc: cqhci: support for command queue enabled host
	Fix transfer descriptor setting in cqhci_set_tran_desc() for 32-bit DMA

Changes since V3:
	Adjusted ...blk_end_request...() for new block status codes
	Fixed CQHCI transaction descriptor for "no DCMD" case

Changes since V2:
	Dropped patches that have been applied.
	Re-based
	Added "mmc: sdhci-pci: Add CQHCI support for Intel GLK"

Changes since V1:

	"Share mmc request array between partitions" is dependent
	on changes in "Introduce queue semantics", so added that
	and block fixes:

	Added "Fix is_waiting_last_req set incorrectly"
	Added "Fix cmd error reset failure path"
	Added "Use local var for mqrq_cur"
