We do pm_runtime_get_sync(&card->dev) always i.e.

void mmc_get_card(struct mmc_card *card, struct mmc_ctx *ctx)
{
	pm_runtime_get_sync(&card->dev);
	__mmc_claim_host(card->host, ctx, NULL);
}

Unfortunately it was just a hack to the blk-mq core - the block layer does
not have an unbound workqueue.  I have not had time to consider a proper
fix.  It will have to wait, but I agree 3% is not enough to delay going forward.
