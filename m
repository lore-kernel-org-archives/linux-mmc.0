I don't think that can be derived from the definition of the context.
Instead, the important part is that we separate the data with predictable
lifetime from data with unpredictable lifetime. If we happen to be
writing both a linear file on the one hand (or multiple such files) and
at the same time updating a database, any reasonable implementation would
be able to benefit from the fact that the linear data is now in a different
erase block from the random-access data. The database file is still
screwed like it is without context support, but it no longer makes
the linear access worse.

Right. The danger here is that the context support was described in
the standard first, while none of the devices seem to even be
smart enough to make use of the information we put in there. Once
operating systems start putting some data in there, at least
some manufacturers will start making use of that data to optimize
the accesses, but it's very unlikely that they will tell us exactly
what they are doing. Having code in ext4 that uses the contexts will
at least make it more likely that the firmware optimizations are
based on ext4 measurements rather than some other file system or
operating system.

is very high on the list of file systems to optimize for, because
they all target Android products.
