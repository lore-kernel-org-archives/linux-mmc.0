Not sure how much you are bound by this.
Previous attempts, adopting a pragmatic approach - just added another ioctl=
 number, and used /dev/mmcblkN.
Moreover, a designated ioctl allows to address more cleanly the rpmb-specif=
ic needs, that are somehow awkward using multi_cmd.
Within the context of an RFC, would be interesting to know if someone even =
used  /dev/mmcblkNrpmb?

I think that the key benefit of Tomas's approach, is being so comprehensive=
.
Thus enables pmb access of embedded block devices - mmc as well as other.
