I'm not an expert on the MMC CMDQ feature, but I know blk-mq pretty
well, so based on that and the decription of the series CMDQ finally
allows MMC to implement one single queue almost properly, but certainly
not multiple queues.

In block storage terms a queue is something where the OS can send
multiple commands to the device and let the device operate on them in
parallel (or at least pseudo-parallel).  Even with the MMC CMDQ feature
is seems after queueing up command the host still needs to control
execution ordering by talking to the hardware again for each command,
which isn't up to par with what other standards have been doing for the
last decades.  It's certainly not support for multiple queues, which
is defined as hardware features where the host allows multiple issuers
to use queue entirely independently of each other.

Note that error handling actually is one of the areas where queues
don't actually operate entirely independently once you escalate high
enough (device / controller reset).  For modern-ish protocols like
SCSI or NVMe the first level of error handling (abort) actually doesn't
involve the queue at all at the protocol, just the failed command.
But once that fails we quickly escalate to a reset, which involves
more than the queue.

Strictly speaking it's not even a a real hardware queue in that case,
but with enough workarounds in the driver we can probably make it look
like a queue at least.  Certainly not multiple queues, though.

That's not entirely correct.  blk-mq is designed to replace the legacy
request code eventually.  The focus is on not wasting CPU cycles, and
to support multiple queues (but not require them).  Sequential workloads
should always be as fast as the legacy path and use less CPU cycles,
for random workloads we might have to wait for I/O scheduler support,
which is under way now:

    http://git.kernel.dk/cgit/linux-block/log/?h=blk-mq-sched

All that assumes a properly converted driver, which as seen by your 
experiments isn't easy for MMC as it's a very convoluted beast thanks
the hardware interface which isn't up to the standards we expect from
block storage protocols.
