The queue depth is not the arbiter of whether we can issue a request.  That
means there will certainly be times when we have to return
BLK_MQ_RQ_QUEUE_BUSY from ->queue_rq() and perhaps stop the queue as well.

We could start with ->queue_rq() feeding every request to the existing
thread and work towards having it submit requests immediately when possible.
 Currently mmc core cannot submit mmc_requests without waiting, but the
command queue implementation can for read/write requests when the host
controller and card are runtime resumed and the card is switched to the
correct internal partition (and we are not currently discarding flushing or
recovering), so it might be simpler to start with cmdq ;-)

No, for synchronous requests, it would be the same as now. ->queue_rq()
would be called in the context of the submitter and would wake the thread
just like ->request_fn() does now.

It would still be better to start simple, and measure the performance, than
to guess where the bottlenecks are.
