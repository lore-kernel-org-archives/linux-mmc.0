Hi Park,

Thanks a lot for the response.

>implementation or extend it?

Yes, file system set REQ_DISCARD flag to notify block device driver to execute TRIM.
And I noticed there's already a flag REQ_META used for file system meta data.
But seems only gfs2 file system uses the REQ_META flag, other file systems (including ext4 and btrfs) have not used this flag.
Is the flag useless or any other reason?

>I'm not familiar with NCQ implementation but it's also helpful to implement it.

I don't know much about NCQ, too. Just have a impression that NCQ is only for SATA hard disk, can it also be used for block device, such as the mmc block device?

Thanks.

Regards,
Yunpeng
