Ok, that sounds like it's the same order of magnitued, which definitely
helps. The most common erase block sizes today are 4 MB and 8 MB,
though they tend to double every one or two years.

I see. It's quite common to have a multiple of three nowadays (1.5M B,
3 MB, 6 MB, 12 MB) because of the way that TLC flash is getting used,
but I've also seen TLC based devices that cut a 4 MB erase block in
three parts, rounded to the next superpage size (1376+1376+1344 KB).

In the former case, we might represent that as a stride=2^n and
stripe-width=3*stride if that helps, in the latter case it sounds
like it has to be stride=stripe-width=2^n anyway.
Usually we're interested in the larger of these two sizes anyway.
