Damned I wish I could be hands-on with this system and bisect
it. It's very helpful with shaky systems really. Sadly the errors are
hard to reproduce :(

The old errors look like so:

So something was causing errors on the read command.

The new errors look like so:

[    6.099171] sunxi-mmc 1c0f000.mmc: smc 0 err, cmd 18, RD SBE !!
[    6.105259] sunxi-mmc 1c0f000.mmc: data error, sending stop command

[    8.623257] sunxi-mmc 1c0f000.mmc: fatal err update clk timeout

This "fatal err update clk timeout" is new and is coming from the driver.

[    8.776985] LR is at mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq+0x124/0x370

And now it is crashing at mmc_blk_rw_rq_prep() + 0x20 so I suspect it is one of
these:

struct mmc_blk_request *brq = &mqrq->brq;
struct request *req = mqrq->req;
struct mmc_blk_data *md = mq->blkdata;

I guess the first: mqrq is NULL.

So I suspect the oneliner in commit 0ebd6e72b5ee2592625d5ae567a729345dfe07b6
"mmc: block: do not assign mq_rq when aborting command"

That is not easily reverted so I will sent a RTF patch to restore the behaviour.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
