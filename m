I do not see it as a delay to anything, it is a motivation for
my work. I am telling you why I am still working on my patch
set, what is driving and motivating it.

I guess CQE is driving and motivating your work?

I don't understand who you are addressing or accusing.

Nobody wants to delay CQE if that is what you are implying,
I want to see it supported as much as you do.

I just prefer to see MQ happen first, and now you say your patch
set does that and that is great, so I just need to review the code
better I guess?
