OK if you merge your stuff I can iterate my patches on top,
no problem.

This is because the entire block layer can be compiled as a
module.

In that case CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK contains 'm' instead of 'y'
which confusingly does not evaluate to true in the preprocessor
(it assumes it is a misspelled 'n' I guess).

And then the autobuilders wreak havoc.

And that is why the IS_ENABLED() defines exist in the first
place IIUC.

I'm all for making CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK into a bool... but
don't know how people (Intel laptops) feel about that extra
code in their kernel at all times.

If we start doing stubs we should stub everything IMO, but if you
prefer I can make that a separate patch. Seems a bit overdone
though.

Module symbol resolution and driver loading is always necessary,
it is no different for e.g. a wifi driver using the 802.11 library.
It is definately possible to shoot oneself in the foot, but I think
udev & friends usually load things in the right order?

Only for these two files but yes.

ext_csd is a bit dubious as it is only available on storage devices
(eMMC) that can not be SD, SDIO or combo cards, and we could make
it only appear if using the block layer.

The card status however we need to keep if people want it.

We *COULD* consider just thrashing these debugfs files. It is not
technically ABI and I wonder who is actually using them.
