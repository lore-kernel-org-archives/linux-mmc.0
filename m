None of which was necessary for blk-mq support.

The queue depth also sets the number of requests, so you are strangling the
I/O scheduler.

Not true.  CQE support worked perfectly before blk-mq and did not depend on
blk-mq in any way.  Obviously the current CQE patch set actually implements
the CQE requirements for blk-mq - which this patch set does not.

That is how CQE has always worked.  It worked that way just fine without blk-mq.

I waited a long time for your patches but I had to give up waiting when Ulf
belated insisted on blk-mq before CQE.  I am not sure what you are expecting
now it seems too late.
