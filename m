Um.  I don't think I can audit all the calls in the kernel that submit
block requests and determine which ones need to be allowed while a
system sleep is in progress.

Well, there are some dedicated threads that exist for no other purpose
than to do I/O to devices and to handle hotplug/unplug events.  I don't
see any reason not allow such threads to be freezable.  It's a quick, 
convenient method for getting them out of the way.

More general-purpose threads, like the async_schedule reservoir and 
workqueue threads, are a different story.
