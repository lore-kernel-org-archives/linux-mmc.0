Yes. That seems reasonable.

However, the most important part here is the comparison between the
different code bases.

Perhaps if Linus can share a branch of the code integrated for the
different tests, we all can help out running them on those HW we have
at hand. Would you be willing to help out here?

I want MMC to move to the new BLKMQ interface and I want that because
of several reasons, see below.

1. It's new blk interface, all new development happens here. We should
use it to benefit from that.
2. The BLKMQ interface allow the MMC block device driver to be
significantly cleaner implemented - and I need that to be able to
maintain the code.
3. We want to make use of Paolo's BFQ-MK I/O scheduler, which
addresses provides guaranteed low latency. For example being able to
play a video clip, while doing a disc backup without getting frame
drops.

Kind regards
Uffe
