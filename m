I'm not sure I agree.

If you treat root fs as removable, you'll get "crash". You'll need to
replay the journal, but data is safe.

If you treat it as non-removable, and someone manages to remove it,
mount, and reinsert, you'll get silent data corruption.

If the card is not removable, mark it as such...
