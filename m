I don't quite follow this. Isn't what you request exactly what
patch 15/16 "mmc: queue: issue requests in massive parallel"
is doing?

The whole patch series leads up to that.

I think this is what it does at the end of the patch series, patch 15/16.
I have to split it somehow...

Essentially I take out that thread and replace it with this one worker
introduced in this very patch. I agree the driver can block in many ways
and that is why I need to have it running in process context, and this
is what the worker introduced here provides.

Maybe I'm getting something backwards, sorry then :/
