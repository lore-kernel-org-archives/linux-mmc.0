This makes a crucial change to the issueing mechanism for the
MMC requests:

Before commit "mmc: core: move the asynchronous post-processing"
some parallelism on the read/write requests was achieved by
speculatively postprocessing a request and re-preprocess and
re-issue the request if something went wrong, which we discover
later when checking for an error.

This is kind of ugly. Instead we need a mechanism like here:

We issue requests, and when they come back from the hardware,
we know if they finished successfully or not. If the request
was successful, we complete the asynchronous request and let a
new request immediately start on the hardware. If, and only if,
it returned an error from the hardware we go down the error
path.

This is achieved by splitting the work path from the hardware
in two: a successful path ending up calling down to
mmc_blk_rw_done_success() and an errorpath calling down to
mmc_blk_rw_done_error().

This has a profound effect: we reintroduce the parallelism on
the successful path as mmc_post_req() can now be called in
while the next request is in transit (just like prior to
commit "mmc: core: move the asynchronous post-processing")
but ALSO we can call mmc_queue_bounce_post() and
blk_end_request() in parallel.

The latter has the profound effect of issuing a new request
again so that we actually need to have at least three requests
in transit at the same time: we haven't yet dropped the
reference to our struct mmc_queue_req so we need at least
three. I put the pool to 4 requests for now.

I expect the imrovement to be noticeable on systems that use
bounce buffers since they can now process requests in parallel
with post-processing their bounce buffers, but I don't have a
test target for that.
