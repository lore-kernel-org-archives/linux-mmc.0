	I guess it might benefit CMDQ since multi-thread can more easily let
	CMDQ achieve full performance. It is just my guess. We shall wait for
	the test result.

	Based on my own experience on developing CMDQ driver, some of the issues, like different
	partition and ioctl, can be solved by getting and putting mmc_host (mmc_claim_host/mmc_release_host).
	The key issue is Direct-CMD, It will be more complex to handle Direct-CMD with blk-mq,
	than doing it with current block layer. With current block layer, I just let CMDQ driver
	borrow existing non-CMDQ transfer routine, and turn back to CMDQ transfer routine
	after DCMD completes. But I'm not the effort we need with blk-mq.

	My key point is, please correct me if I'm wrong, shall we avoid binding CMDQ and
	non-CMDQ card layer together?
	To be honest, I don't think CMDQ is a good design. It will bring a lot of troubles.
	In my very own opinion, if we try to develop a single routine to support both CMDQ
	and non-CMDQ, it will be painful to both sides.

	Thank you.

Best regards,
Hu Ziji
