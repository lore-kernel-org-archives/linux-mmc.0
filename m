I think we have to be careful not to trade latency in one place
for a bigger latency in another place.

Right now, the handoff between blk and mmc introduces an inherent
latency in some cases, and blk-mq was designed to avoid that by
allowing minimizing the number of cpu cycles between the file
system and the hardware, as well as minimizing the depth of the
queue on the software side.

Having the driver do its own queuing (as dasd and mmc both do
today) is worse for both of the above, since you need extra
context switches for a single I/O with an empty queue, while
a full queue can add a lot of latency that is out of reach of
the I/O scheduler: a high-priority request can be moved ahead
of the block queue, but cannot bypass anything that is already
in a driver-internal queue.

The tradeoff in both cases is that we can prepare (build a
dasd channel program, or have dma_map_sg manage cache and
iommu) a new request while waiting for the previous one,
reducing the latency between two requests being worked on
by the hardware on devices without hardware queuing.

We clearly want to have both benefits as much as possible,
and having a ->prepare() callback is probably better here
than a longer private queue in the device driver.

With the packed commands on MMC, we have a degenerated queue,
as we would sometimes submit multiple blk requests together
as one MMC command. Here, advertizing a longer queue as I
described earlier may be the best option.
