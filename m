I have applied patches 1->19 for next.  Deferring patch 21->23 for a while.

For those patches that was more or less the same as in v14, I added Linus' ack.

Hopefully we get some help for the community to test this series on
different HW (and I will be checking kernelci's boot reports). I
haven't added Bartlomiej's tested-by and neither Linus' (because of
the changes that has been made), so I hoping that will happen sooner
or later.

Moreover, I will gladly add more peoples acks/reviewed-by and
tested-by tags, at any point during this release cycle.

Thanks and kind regards
Uffe
