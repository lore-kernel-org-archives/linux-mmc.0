You really need to test cards that are fast.  A decent UHS-I SD card can do
over 80 MB/s for reads and of course HS400 eMMC can do over 300 MB/s.

That is a side-issue.  A single small patch can change that.

Re-tuning and background operations are rare and slow, so there is no reason
to try to start them from interrupt context.

It already works that way.  Re-tuning happens before you start a request.
We prevent re-tuning in between dependent requests, like between starting a
transfer and CMD13 polling for completion.
