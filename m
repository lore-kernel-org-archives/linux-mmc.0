Nope.  This is new functionality - doesn't affect anyone who doesn't have a
command queue engine.  Next to no chance of regressions.  Tested by several
in the community.  Substantially unchanged since February.  It is not even
very much code in the block driver.

You said that in February.  Never happened.  You said you wanted blk-mq, so
I waited to re-base on top, but it never appeared.

It has been more than 6 months.  That is enough time to wait for "consensus".
