This had been a bug[1] which I saw when playing around with my Aspire One=
 (which
features a mmc driven card reader) and ext4.

The problem is inherited from the way the mmc driver handles cards on sus=
pend.
So when using a mmcblk device and suspending it is like ejecting the card=
 on
suspend.

The problem gets worse when actually using a filesystem on that device. A=
nd
there is a difference between having the fs mounted by udisk under /media=
 or
having done the mount manually. I suspect that udisk either adds its own =
hooks
into udev events or has some sort of watch on the mount point. At least e=
jecting
the card manually or suspending will usually also an unmount of the fs. T=
his
becomes a bit of a problem when the fs is in use (the simplest form being=
 to
open a shell and changing the current directory into the fs on the card).=
 In
that case the entry in /proc/mounts is gone but some fs structures remain=
=2E

And here one specialty of ext4 strikes: it creates some entries under
/proc/fs/ext4/mmcblk*, /proc/fs/jbd2/mmcblk* and /sys/fs/ext4/mmcblk* (an=
d some
internal kobj) which remain dangling together with the structures. So whe=
n
resuming the user is presented with:

  a) a scary dialog box telling that mount has failed because of (fuzzy r=
eason
     including missing superblocks) which is even more scary because ther=
e has
     been a bug in the past which turned this into reality (good bye data=
).
  b) three WARN messages (including stack trace) to tell about the duplic=
ate
     objects.

Clearly anything that had a file (or directory node) open will be screwed=
 and
receive IO errors when trying any access. So the obvious mount failure ju=
st
makes it very clear that this is a bad place to be in. Or is the expectat=
ion
that users of the old mount should just be getting IO errors and the new =
mount
is supposed to succeed?

I reached a bit my limits of knowledge here (hence the longish email). Sh=
ould
ext4 be expected to find out its backing device is gone and then at least=
 remove
the sysfs and procfs entries related to that? And even if so, how? Or is =
it
better the way it is, so at least the fact that the block device went awa=
y is
clearly visible? I am pretty sure any filesystem has the same first half =
of the
issue (maybe dangling open files) but just don't have anything that preve=
nts
them from being remounted.

There also is a relatively simple way to handle it (when one is aware and=
 knows
about it). The mmc core can be instructed to treat cards as non-removable=

(mmc_core.removable=3D0) which has its own dangers. I thought that still =
on resume
there is a check for the card being the same. I just don't know how relia=
ble (or
how unique the identification is) that is. So while this allows to suspen=
d and
resume without headaches it potentially can cause some more when the card=
 is
replaced without that being detected.

So long story, sort of short question: is there anything that can/should =
be done
or is it just something that cannot be done any better way?

Thanks,
Stefan
