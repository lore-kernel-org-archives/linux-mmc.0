We also had a patch on the pinctrl side in 4.10, whose side effects
would be to disable the pull ups on some boards that have not been
configuring their pins properly (while the previous behaviour was to
keep what the bootloader set).

That board seems to fall in that category.

That behaviour has been reverted, and Linus merged it already, so it
might be entirely unrelated to that serie.
