Nitpick: I think mmc_blk_read_single() would be better as it is a more
clear name. Would you mind changing it?

What happens here if the reason to the error is because the card was removed?

I guess next time __blk_err_check() is called from the
mmc_blk_mq_rw_recovery(), this will be detected and managed?

Shouldn't you check "if (blk_rq_bytes(req) <  512)"? How would you
otherwise read the last 512 bytes block?

Shouldn't we actually bail out, unless the error is a data ECC error?
On the other hand, I guess if it a more severe error, cmd.error will
anyway be set above!?

One more question, if there is a data error, we may want to try to
recover by sending a stop command? How do we manage that?

Nitpick: Can we please try to find a better name for this function. I
don't think "acct" is good abbreviation because, to me, it's not
self-explaining.

I have tried to convince myself that the protection of calling
mmc_get|put_card() is safe, but I am not sure.

I am wondering whether there could be races for mmc_get|put_card().
Please see some more related comments below.

The synchronization methods is one of the most complex part of
$subject patch, yet also very elegant!

Anyway, would you mind adding some more comments here and there in the
code, to explain a bit about what goes on and why?

For example, a comment here about: "In case there is a new request
prepared, leave it to that, to deal with finishing and post processing
of the request, else schedule a work to do it - and see what comes
first."

Also here it would be nice with some comments about the
synchronization. I stop from mentioning this from now on, because it
applies to a couple of more places.

I leave it to you to decide how and where it makes sense to add these
kind of comments.

To be honest, using a queue_depth of 64, puzzles me! According to my
understanding we should use a queue_depth of 2, in case the host
implements the ->pre|post_req() callbacks, else we should set it to 1.

Although I may be missing some information about how to really use
this, because for example UBI (mtd) also uses 64 as queue depth!?

My interpretation of the queue_depth is that the blkmq layer will use
it to understand the maximum number of request a block device are able
to operate on simultaneously (when having one HW queue), thus the
number of outstanding dispatched requests for the block evice driver,
may be as close as possible to the queue_depth, but never above. I may
be totally wrong about this. :-)

Anyway, then if using a queue_depth of 64, how will you make sure that
you not end up having > 1 requests being prepared at the same time
(not counting the one that may be in transfer)?

What if there is an ongoing request, shouldn't you wait for that to
complete before switching partition?

Wouldn't it be possible that yet a new SYNC request becomes queued in
parallel with this current one. Then, when reaching this point, how do
you make sure that new request waits for the current "SYNC" request?

I mean is the above mmc_blk_wait_for_idle(), really sufficient to deal
with synchronization?

I guess we could use mmc_claim_host(no-ctx) in some clever way to deal
with this, or perhaps there is a better option?

BTW, I guess the problem is also present if there is SYNC request
ongoing and then is a new ASYNC request coming in. Is the ASYNC
request really waiting for the SYNC request to finish?

Or maybe I just missed these parts in $subject patch.

Coming back to the get_card() thingy, which I wonder if it's fragile.

A request that finds get_card == true here, doesn't necessarily have
to reach to this point first (the task may be preempted), in case
there is another request being queued in parallel (or that can't
happen?).

That could then lead to that the following steps become executed for
the other requests, prior anybody calling mmc_get_card().

For the similar reasons as above, this also looks fragile.

I already mentioned my thoughts around the queue_depth... and again I
may be totally wrong. :-)
