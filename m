I don't think that small degradation is a reason for not enabling mq,
although for sure we should continue to investigate why it is.

Yep, this needs to be fixed.

Alright, let's go with this option!

I think most of Ming's patches addressing performance issues should be
in Linus' master already, so once I have a my next branch based on
4.15rc1, we should be able to run a new round of test.

Anyway, if anything else is needed from the generic block layer, sure
I am open to pull in a branch if needed.

Right. So, let's then forget about my suggested approach and spend
time more wisely on Adrian's series.

Yep. As stated above, let's go for that solution.

I will then be awaiting a new version from Adrian, hopefully I can
apply his series already when rc1 is out, to make sure we get enough
time to smoke out any remaining problems.

Kind regards
