Done!

Thanks for explanation! It makes more sense to me now!

My my point is that *if* the card debugfs nodes shows up to the user -
they should work (no matter if the mmc block device has been probed or
not).

Can we guarantee that, is this approach?

Yes, that's a nice option.

Again, this is for debug purpose. I don't see an issue moving also
this one within CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK.

Right.

According to Avri, apparently some userspace tools measuring
performance. I would be interested to know a bit more about those
tools.

Kind regards
