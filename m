Hi Linus,

Thanks for getting back on this.

This depends. There is a command CMD48 which can knock off the error'd 
out task from the queue. But in case if the reset of controller and card 
is required(for some error) then yes, all requests in queue needs to be 
re-queued back and removed from the card queue.

Also there are certain CMDs which can be *only* issued while the queue 
of emmc is empty. Otherwise they will be treated as illegal commands.
So yes, there is a dependency in previously issued requests - which 
means (as you said) that for blk-mq we should consider in HW/SW CMDQ as 
1 HW queue with certain qdepth advertised by card.

Yes, thanks for explaining. Agree.

Ok. Could you please elaborate how a regression?

 From very little understanding on blk-mq, I see that it does have 
plugging mechanism in place. So merging wont be a problem for most of 
the use cases right?
So are you referring to priority given to sync requests v/s async or 
idle type requests, which were taken care in CFQ ?
For my own understanding, I would like to understand under what 
scenarios or why we should expect a performance regression in blk-mq for 
mmc driver without blk-mq scheduling?

Ok. Yes, I do see blk-mq scheduling patches on the mailing lists.

Thanks!!
