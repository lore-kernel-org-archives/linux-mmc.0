I like this approach.

mmc-utils is also far better in parsing the results from ext csd and
presents the output in a more human readable format.

Moreover, people that needs to debug the behavior of a card should
likely not have a problem with using mmc-utils.

I decided to pick patch 1->4 at this stage as those looks nice and
clean. The rest will need a re-spin.

Thanks and kind regards
