Unfortunate, there is more. :-)

We are actually registering at least three more block devices per eMMC
card (two boot partitions, and one general purpose partition). Except
for the main partition of course.

The difference compared to rpmb from the above, is that those are
actually general read/write partitions.

So all these partitions are on the same eMMC card, but being I/O
scheduled separately because there are separate block devices. Yeah,
starvation, latency, etc - all bad things comes with it. :-)

My point is, this is only the first step in re-working and fixing this
- and we really appreciate your review!

Kind regards
