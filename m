We have weekends in Sweden - and I also work on other things than mmc :-).

I do however admit, that I could have been reviewing a bit faster
throughout the re-spins. Apologize for that, but I am only doing my
best.

That would be very nice, however be aware of that we are in the merge
window, so I am not picking new material for 4.14 from this point. I
assume you understand why.

Still, big changes is always nice to queue up early for a release
cycle. Let's aim for that!

Moreover, I am not delaying CQE, but really want it to be merged asap!
However, I am also having the role as a maintainer and the things that
comes with it. For example, I would like the community to reach
consensus around how to move forward with CQE, before I decide to pick
it up.

Kind regards
Uffe
