Right, I had the same idea and I think even talked to you about that.
I think this would address case 'b)' above perfectly, but I don't
see how we can fit case 'c)' in that scheme.

Maybe if we could teach blk_mq that a device might be able to not
just merge consecutive requests but also a limited set of
non-consecutive requests in a way that MMC needs them? Unfortunately,
the 'packed command' is rather MMC specific, and it might even
be worthwhile to do some optimization regarding what commands
get packed (e.g. only writes, only small requests, or only up to
a total size).

While there are some parallels to DASD, but it's not completely
the same, even if we ignore the command packing.

- MMC wants the 'prepare' stage to reduce the latency from
  dma_map_sg() calls. This is actually more related to the
  CPU/SoC architecture and really important on most ARM systems
  as they are not cache coherent, but it's not just specific
  to MMC other than MMC performance on low-end ARM being
  really important to a lot of people since it's used in all
  Android phones.
  If we could find a way to get blk_mq to call blk_rq_map_sg()
  for us, we wouldn't need a ->prepare() step or a fake queue
  for case 'b)', and we could make use of that in other drivers
  too.

- DASD in contrast wants to build the channel programs while
  other I/O is running, and this is very specific to that
  driver. There are probably some other things it does in its
  own queue implementation that are also driver specific.

I'm probably not going to work on it myself, but I think it would
be great for Linus and/or Ulf to bring this up at LSF/MM.
