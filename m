Oh, well *that's* easy.  Whichever process opens the file drops a
context ID into fs-specific inode structure (for ext4, that would be
struct ext4_inode_info), and if a second process opens the file, we
use the same context ID.  When the last file descriptor for the inode
is closed, we zap the context ID.

It also occurs to me that if a file is being written to by two
processes, it's likely that it's a update-in-place database, and we
want to treat those special; no matter what the size, we probably
don't want to group that file into the same context as the others.
More generally, if a file is opened without O_CREAT, it's probably a
good bet that it wants to either be in a context by itself, or not
part of any context.

The files which we would probably find most interesting is the files
which are created from scratch, and more specifically, for files which
are dumped out all at once: i.e., open w/O_CREAT, optional fallocate,
write, optional fsync, and close.  If we can detect a series of file
operations with this characteristic originating from the same process,
when we detect a second open w/O_CREAT very shortly after the first
O_CREAT in the same directory from the same process, we simply reuse
the context ID for the second and subsequent files.

Well, for file systems with delayed allocation, this is actually
pretty easy.  By the time we do the writeback for a file with delayed
allocation, if it's substantially bigger than the erase block size and
we haven't yet written any blocks for the file, we should give it a
new context ID.  And furthermore, your idea that we should try to
align the file on an erase block boundary would be a great thing to
do.

What would be *great* is if the erase block size were exposed in
sysfs, and that the blockid library (which is how mke2fs and other
similar mkfs programs get other storage device parameters) were
enhanced to return this information.

Yes, although presumably aligning large files to erase block
boundaries would still be useful, yes?

So adding an erase block size to the ext2/3/4 superblock sounds like a
first great step.  By making it be a superblock field, that way it's
possible to override the value returned by the hardware if it turns
out to be a lie, and we can also use programs like flashbench to
figure out the erase block size and populate the superblock value via
some userspace process.  (Possibly called out of mke2fs directly if we
can automate it completely, and make it dead reliable.)
