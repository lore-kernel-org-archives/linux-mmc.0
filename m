	In my very own opinion, (although I'm not the expert of marketing),
	quad-core platforms will be more and more popular.
	Quad-core might have a different result, especially when we are
	testing multiple threads.

	Actually, there is a parameter to limit the size of test file in iozone.
	I'm not sure why you need to scan the whole eMMC. But I personally
	believe it is unnecessary.

	Sorry for delay reply. Hope your eMMC is not broken yet. :p
	eMMC usually contains much more physical pages than the capacity
	it shows. Thus I guess your eMMC should be fine unless you torture
	it by entirely writing it again and again.

	I see. Thank you for the details.

	I strongly agree with you on it.

	Thank you.
