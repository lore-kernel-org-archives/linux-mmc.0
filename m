Yes.

A few more questions: 

* On cards that can only write to a single erase block at a time,
should I make the block group size the same as the as the erase
block? I suppose writing both block bitmaps, inode and data to
separate erase blocks would create multiple eraseblock
read-modify-write cycles for every single file otherwise.

* Is it guaranteed that inode bitmap, inode, block bitmap and
blocks are always written in low-to-high sector order within
one ext4 block group? A lot of the drives will do a garbage-collect
step (adding hundreds of miliseconds) every time you move back
inside of the eraseblock.

* Is there any way to make ext4 use effective blocks larger
than 4 KB? The most common size for a NAND flash page is 16
KB right (effectively, ignoring what the hardware does), so
it would be good to never write smaller.

* Calling TRIM on SD cards is probably counterproductive unless
you trim entire erase blocks. Is that even possible with ext4,
assuming that we use block group == erase block?

* Is there a way to put the journal into specific parts of the
drive? Almost all SD cards have an area in the second 4 MB
(more for larger cards) that can be written using random access
without forcing garbage collection on other parts.

Ok. Recently, cheap TLC (three-level cell, 3-bit MLC) NAND is
becoming popular. I've seen erase block sizes of 6 MiB, 1376 KiB
(4096 / 3, rounded up) and 4128 KiB (1376 * 3) because of this, in
place of the common 4096 KiB. The SD card standard specifies
values of 12 MB and 24 MB aside from the usual power-of-two values
up to 64 MB for large cards (>32GB), while smaller cards are allowed
only up to 4 MB erase blocks and need to be power-of-two. Many
cards do not use the size they claim in their registers.
