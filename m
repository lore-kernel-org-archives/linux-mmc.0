Right, we definitely need to have something that allows us
to send larger commands to the device for scattered requests.

It wouldn't hurt to reconsider whether the current method is
the most efficient way of doing this, but that doesn't seem to
be a priority to me. If the MMC bounce buffers get in the way
of the blk-mq conversion, we could try to come up with a
different implementation as part of that conversion.

I think the bounce buffers in the DMA-API (swiotlb) should be
kept separate since it has a completely different purpose of
bouncing pages within the dma mask, rather than linearizing
a sglist.

If I read this right, we used to use blk-bounce for highmem
pages and mmc-bounce for lowmem until 2ff1fa679115 ("mmc_block:
bounce buffer highmem support") in 2008, now we don't
use blk-bounce at all if mmc-bounce is in use.

The mmc-bounce code is active on hosts that have 'max_segs=1'
(the default unless they override it). These one set it to '1'
explicitly:

drivers/mmc/host/au1xmmc.c:     mmc->max_segs = AU1XMMC_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT;
drivers/mmc/host/bfin_sdh.c:    mmc->max_segs = 1; /* only BF51x */
drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c:               mmc->max_segs = 1; /* with
SDHCI_USE_SDMA */
drivers/mmc/host/ushc.c:        mmc->max_segs      = 1;
drivers/mmc/host/via-sdmmc.c:   mmc->max_segs = 1;

These have max_segs=1 but ask for bounce buffers to be
disabled, which will severely limit their performance:

drivers/mmc/host/cavium.c:              mmc->max_segs = 1; /*
cavium,octeon-6130-mmc */
drivers/mmc/host/pxamci.c: mmc->max_segs = NR_SG;

These ones don't seem to set it at all, defaulting to '1':
drivers/mmc/host/cb710-mmc.c
drivers/mmc/host/moxart-mmc.c
drivers/mmc/host/sdricoh_cs.c
drivers/mmc/host/toshsd.c
