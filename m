So since MMCI need the post_req() hook called with
an error code to properly tear down any DMA operations,
I was worried that maybe your error path is not doing this
(passing an error code or calling in the right order).

I had a bunch of fallouts in my own patch set relating
to that.

They are treated as independent by the block layer but
it is the subsystems duty to serialize them for the hardware,

MMCI strictly requires that pre/post hooks per request
happen in the right order, so if you have prepared a second
request after submitting the first, and the first fails, you have
to back out by unpreparing the second one before unpreparing
the first. It is also the only host driver requireing to be passed
an error code in the last parameter to the post hook in
order to work properly.

I think your patch set handles that nicely though, because I
haven't seen any errors, it's just when we do this direct
completion I see problems.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
