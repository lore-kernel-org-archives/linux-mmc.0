That doesn't seem like a very good idea.  It will significantly limit the size of the filesystem, and will cause a lot of overhead (two bitmaps per group for only a handful of blocks).

Generally, yes.  I don't think there is a hard guarantee, but the block device elevator will sort the blocks.

You may be interested in Ted's bigalloc patchset.  This will force block allocation to be at a power-of-two multiple of the blocksize, so it could be 16kB or whatever.  However, this is inefficient if the average filesize is not large enough.

That is already the case, if the underlying storage reports the erase block size to the filesystem.

That would need a small patch to mke2fs.  I've been interested in this also for other reasons, but haven't had time to work on it.  It will likely need only some small adjustments to ext2fs_add_journal_inode() to allow passing the goal block, and write_journal_inode() to use the goal block instead of its internal heuristic.  The default location of the journal inode was previously moved from the beginning of the filesystem to the middle of the filesystem for performance reasons, so this is mostly already handled.

Well, the large erase block size is not in itself a problem, but if the devices do not use the reported erase block size internally, there is nothing much that ext4 or the rest of the kernel can do about it, since it has no other way of knowing what the real erase block size is.
