Hi

Here is V9 of the hardware command queue patches without the software
command queue patches, now using blk-mq and now with blk-mq support for
non-CQE I/O.

HW CMDQ offers 25% - 50% better random multi-threaded I/O.  I see a slight
2% drop in sequential read speed but no change to sequential write.

Non-CQE blk-mq showed a 3% decrease in sequential read performance.  This
seemed to be coming from the inferior latency of running work items compared
with a dedicated thread.  Hacking blk-mq workqueue to be unbound reduced the
performance degradation from 3% to 1%.

While we should look at changing blk-mq to give better workqueue performance,
a bigger gain is likely to be made by adding a new host API to enable the
next already-prepared request to be issued directly from within ->done()
callback of the current request.
