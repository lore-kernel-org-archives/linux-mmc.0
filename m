	I'm glad to.
	But my available platforms all stay in Linux v4.4/v4.1.
	I can help when my platforms can upgrade.

	Got it. Thanks a lot for your detailed explanation.
	If we focus on the low latency, we shall get a cleaner result
	of IOPS in tests.
	IOPS is a more common performance index in eMMC/SD.

	Thank you.
