The following patches add driver support for MMCSD on TI's AM654
platforms.

Previously I had added the support to sdhci-of-arasan driver with
a separate phy driver[1]. Since then it has turned out that tuning
operation (for HS200, HS400 and SDR104 speed modes) will require
configuration of phy registers. This completely breaks the model of
the sdhci-of-arasan driver which relies on a separate driver to
configure the phy register space.

Because of this, I am creating a new driver with both the sdhci and
phy register spaces. This helps me use the phy registers in a future
patch that adds tuning support.

DT patches will be posted in a separate series.

Changes in v3:
 1. Removed reference to clk_ahb as its not being used.
 2. Added comment for pm_runtime being used for enabling
    clocks.

Changes in v2:
 1. Reset OTAP delay back to default value in init.
 2. Improved patch description for patch 2.
 3. Minor style fixes.
