What's the current status of this patch series?

I haven't seen much if any comment from the mm folks and the xfs/ocfs2
folks.  I've incorporated the patches into the unstable portion of the
ext4 tree so I can do some testing (some minor changes to the ext4
patches were needed to rebase the patch series to the 3.6-rc1-based
ext4 dev tree, but nothing major).  However, I don't want to include
this into the ext4 tree for merging into linux-next unless we get
general agreement from the maintainers of the other trees that are
affected by this patch series.

Thansk,
