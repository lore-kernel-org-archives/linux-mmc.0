Hi

Here is V6 of the hardware command queue patches without the software
command queue patches.  Patches "mmc: host: Add CQE interface" and
"mmc: core: Turn off CQE before sending commands" have been applied to Ulf's
next branch.  "mmc: host: Add CQE interface" needs to be dropped in favour
of the new version.

HW CMDQ offers 25% - 50% better random multi-threaded I/O.  I see a slight
2% drop in sequential read speed but no change to sequential write.

We need to start with the legacy block API because people want to backport
CQ to earlier kernels (we really need to get features upstream more
quickly), but blk-mq has been evolving a lot (e.g. elevator support), so
backporters face having either something quite different from upstream or
trying to backport great chunks of the block layer.

We also don't know how blk-mq will perform so it would be prudent to start
with support for both the legacy API and blk-mq (as scsi does) so that we
can find out first.

RFC patches to support blk-mq can be found here:
