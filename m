So this change should more or less restore the behavior we had before
this series. I would actually be interested to see a comparison in
throughput towards that, before moving on to the last patch12, which
converts to blkmq.

Also, if I get things right so far, you have manged to get rid off a
waitqueue but instead introduced a worker, so from context switching
point of view, it would be interesting to see how/if that affects
things.

I do some tests myself and let you know the results.

I was trying to wrap my head around what this really means from a
request preparation point of view.

Can't we end up here having a new request being prepared, but then
doing error handling and re-trying with the current one?

It's been a long week, so I should probably stop reviewing code by now. :-)

Anyway, it seems like this error path really needs to be properly
tested/triggered, especially to make sure so the above still plays
nicely.

Earlier experiences also tells me that doing a card hotplug in the
middle of transactions could trigger interesting errors, related to
this path.
