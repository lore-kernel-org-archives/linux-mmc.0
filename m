Adrian, this is just too hard for me to review. Please, can you split this up?

At least enabling mq support should be done in a separate and first
step, then you could add the CQE bits on top.

I think that is important, because we want to make sure the mq
deployment is done correctly first. Otherwise it becomes impossible to
narrow down problems, because those could then be either CQE related
or mq related.
