The point here is, if buf is a vmalloc address:

	v = kmap_atomic(virt_to_page(buf))

v may be _anything_ at all.  The kmap_atomic() will be done by the MMC
host driver, the virt_to_page() is done by the code I quoted above.

v may be a lowmem page address.  v may be somewhere in userspace.  v may
be some device mapping.  v may be (if you're lucky) the same address as
"buf".  There's no guarantees what it will be.

Note that the scatterlist above does _not_ store the virtual address
that was passed into it, but only the struct page, offset and length.
So, drivers can not know what the original virtual address was.

sdio_readb() and sdio_writeb() convey the data in the command stream,
not the data stream.  Firstly, sdio_writeb() takes the actual value to
be written, so the memory storage is irrelevant (on many platforms, it
will be passed as a value in CPU registers.)  Eventually, it's written
into the MMC command structure as the command argument, which typically
ends up being written to a host controller register.

In the case of sdio_readb(), the returned value comes from the command
status, which is typically read from registers in the host controller.
mmc_io_rw_direct_host() writes the value to the passed address.  Hence,
the host controller, again, never sees the address.

See above, your understanding of how sdio_readb() and sdio_writeb() is
not correct.  These are single value transfer functions, using
mmc_io_rw_direct() as the underlying method of access, and do not
transfer anything over the data lines.

These functions are quite different from sdio_memcpy_toio(),
sdio_memcpy_fromio(), sdio_readsb() and sdio_writesb(), which are
multiple value transfer functions, and these perform the transfer using
the data lines.  These use sdio_io_rw_ext_helper(), which then uses
mmc_io_rw_extended() to perform the transfer.  The code I quoted in my
original email is from mmc_io_rw_extended().

The command path is entirely separate from the data path in most MMC
host controllers.  The command path is commonly PIO, the data path is
commonly DMA, but host controllers _may_ choose PIO for small transfers
or when they have no DMA support.
