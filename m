Isn't that at the expense of increased memory allocation.

Have you compared the number of allocations?  It looks to me like the block
layer allocates a minimum of 4 requests in the memory pool which will
increase if there are more in the I/O scheduler, plus 1 for flush.  There
are often 4 queues per eMMC (2x boot,RPMB and main area), so that is 20
requests minimum, up from 2 allocations previously.  For someone using 64K
bounce buffers, you have increased memory allocation by at least 18x64 =
1152k.  However the I/O scheduler could allocate a lot more.

Obviously you could create a per-request data structure with only the
reference to the IOCTL data, and without putting all the memory allocations
there as well.
