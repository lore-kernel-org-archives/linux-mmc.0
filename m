OK I will try to get them out of the way and see what happens,
hehe :)

What I mean is that we were checking - on every command -
if BKOPS or retune needs to happen. And then doing it. Thus
all was done in process context.

Ah that is what these if()s do ... right. I'll see if I can get around
this then.
