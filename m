Adrian, I am reviewing this series, however let me comment on each
change individually.

I have also run some test on my ux500 board and enabling the blkmq
path via the new MMC Kconfig option. My idea was to run some iozone
comparisons between the legacy path and the new blkmq path, but I just
couldn't get to that point because of the following errors.

I am using a Kingston 4GB SDHC card, which is detected and mounted
nicely. However, when I decide to do some writes to the card I get the
following errors.

I haven't yet got the point of investigating this any further, and
unfortunate I have a busy schedule with traveling next week. I will do
my best to look into this as soon as I can.

Perhaps you have some ideas?

Kind regards
Uffe
