Can't we virtualize this?  Would this work?

The file system can simply create as many virtual contexts as it
likes; if there are no more contexts available, the block device
simply closes the least recently used context (no matter what
partition).  If the file system tries to use a virtual context where
the underlying physical context has been closed, the block device will
simply open a new physical context (possibly closing some other old
context).

Oh, that's cool.  And I don't think that's hard to do.  We could just
keep a flag in the in-core inode indicating whether it is in "large
unit" mode.  If it is in large unit mode, we can make the fs writeback
function make sure that we adhere to the restrictions of the large
unit mode, and if at any point we need to do something that might
violate the constraints, the file system would simply close the
context.

The only reason I can think of why this might be problematic is if
there is a substantial performance cost involved with opening and
closing contexts on eMMC devices.  Is that an issue we need to be
worried about?

Well, I'm interested in getting something upstream, which is useful
not just for the consumer-grade eMMC devices in handsets, but which
might also be extensible to SSD's, and all the way up to PCIe-attached
flash devices that might be used in large data centers.

I think if we do things right, it should be possible to do something
which would accomodate a large range of devices (which is why I
brought up the concept of exposing virtualized contexts to the file
system layer).
