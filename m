To me it reads more like the timeout is for each block, including the last
i.e. the same timeout for "busy".  Note the card is also busy between blocks.

Equally it is the timeout we give the host controller.  So either the host
controller does not have a timeout for "busy" - which begs the question why
it has a timeout at all - or it invents its own "busy" timeout - which begs
the question why it isn't in the spec.

We give SD cards a generous 3 seconds for writes.  SDHCI has long had a 10
second software timer for the whole request, which strongly suggests that
requests have always completed within 10 seconds.  So that puts the range of
an arbitrary timeout 3-10 s.
