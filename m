This looks good to me!

I only have one, very minor comment.

To make it clear why this is needed, could you please add some comment
in the code?

As I was trying to point out in the other reply about queue depth, for
patch 13, this is weird to me.
This may mean that we end up using queue_depth being less than
MMC_QUEUE_DEPTH (64) for the CQE case. While in fact, in the CQE case
the HW actually supports a bigger queue depth, comparing when not
using CQE.

Anyway, it seems like that will have to be a separate topic to discuss
with the blkmq experts.
