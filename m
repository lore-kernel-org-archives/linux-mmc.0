I think whether issuing an mmc request requires blocking should ideally
be up to the host device driver, at least I'd hope that we can end up
with something like this driving latency to the absolute minimum:

a) with MMC CMDQ support:
  - report actual queue depth
  - have blk-mq push requests directly into the device through
    the mmc-block driver and the host driver
  - if a host driver needs to block, make it use a private workqueue

b) without MMC CMDQ support:
  - report queue depth of '2'
  - first request gets handled as above
  - if one request is pending, prepare the second request and
    add a pointer to the mmc host structure (not that different
    from what we do today)
  - when the host driver completes a request, have it immediately
    issue the next one from the interrupt handler. In case we need
    to sleep here, use a threaded IRQ, or a workqueue. This should
    avoid the need for the NULL requests

c) possible optimization for command packing without CMDQ:
   - similar to b)
   - report a longer queue (e.g. 8, maybe user selectable, to
     balance throughput against latency)
   - any request of the same type (read or write) as the one that
     is currently added to the host as the 'next' one can be
     added to that request so they get issued together
   - if the types are different, report the queue to be busy
