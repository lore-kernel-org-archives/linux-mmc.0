The combined patch is > 1 kLOC which is a lot and since the CQE and
non-CQE code paths are clearly marked it should be really easy to
split them.

We *do* but not in the same step, it is just normal kernel engineering
practice to split patches on logical changes. This is not asking about
something extraordinary.

I would really hope to see more documentation about blk-mq changes
first before starting to review it. The patch description documents
CQE changes but not blk-mq ones and the code itself is also lacking
in-code documentation describing new functions added for blk-mq.
