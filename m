Well, that is a rather big change on its own. Earlier we polled with
CMD13 to verify that the card has moved back to the transfer state, in
case it was a write. And that was no matter of MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY
was set or not. Right!?

I am not sure it's a good idea to bypass that validation, it seems
fragile to rely only on the busy detection on DAT line for writes.

I have used V10.

I don't think mmci has a problem with that, however why do you want to
do this? Wouldn't that defeat some of the benefits with the async
request mechanism?

Kind regards
