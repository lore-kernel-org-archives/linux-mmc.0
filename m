Linus,

Seems like this series may have issues. I have looked at boot reports
from kernelci, and particular the reports for
https://kernelci.org/boot/sun7i-a20-bananapi/job/ulfh/ are
interesting.

Apparently, this board has an SD card attached. There have been errors
reported in the log for a while when doing data transfers, although
none of these errors have triggered the kernelci to report a boot
error.

However, I suspect that some of the changes in this series make it
worse. Perhaps because of a changed error handling the mmc block
layer!?

Particular, look at the difference between these [1] boot logs, it
might give you some hints. I have also added Maxime to this thread,
perhaps he can help out with the sunxi mmc driver.

Kind regards
Uffe
