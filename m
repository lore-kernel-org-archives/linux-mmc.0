I don't see what DMA-coherence has to do with anything.

Possibilities:
	- DMA unmapping doesn't work in an atomic context
	- requests' DMA operations have to be synchronized with each other

I looked at mmci but that did not seem to be the case.

Of course, the requests are treated as independent.  If the separate DMA
operations require synchronization, that is for the host driver to fix.
