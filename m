Adrian, this discussion seems to lead nowhere. Can we please stop and
be constructive instead!

Regarding the arbitration issue. We have been moving forward,
re-factoring the mmc block driver code, soon also solving the problem
for the rpmb internal partition [1]. Maybe the background to why Linus
is working on mmc block re-factoring, hasn't been entirely clear.
Anyway, it's exactly because of moving closer to address these issues.

Even if the problems certainly becomes a step harder to resolve for
the boot and the general purpose partitions, it's still a path we
should try to find a solution for. Yeah, that may mean we need to
suggest changes for the generic block layer, to teach it to better
deal with these kind of devices.

Finally, I have never said the arbitration issue *must* be solved
before converting to blkmq. Only that we should avoid performance
regressions, but that of course applies to whatever changes we do.

Kind regards
Uffe
