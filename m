Hot unplug handling currently is a mess in the block layer (not just the
mq case).  Especially if you ever requeue an I/O there is tons of
boilerplate code.  I wish we could move a little more of this into the
core, but right now I don't have a good idea on how to.

You can still do this with mq, but you have to open code it.  Take a look
at scsi_end_request which has opencoded versions of the mq and non-mq
end_request routines.  Currently it's the only example of blk-mq partial
completions.
