Please correct me if I am wrong, the issues was observed already in
patch 11, before the actual switch to mq was done, right?

That's great. I really appreciate that you have run these tests, that
gives me a good confidence from an overall point of view.

Yeah, this has actually been rather cumbersome to deal with also in
the legacy request path. Let's dive into this in more detail as soon
as possible.

First, I haven't yet commented on the latest version of the mq patch
(patch12 in this series) and neither on Adrians (patch 3 in his
series), but before doing that, let me share my overall view of how we
could move forward, as to see if all of us can agree on that path.

So, what I really like in $subject series is the step by step method,
moving slowly forward enables an easy review, then the actual switch
to mq gets a diff of "3 files changed, 156 insertions(+), 181
deletions(-)". This shows to me, that it can be done! Great work!
Of course, I do realize that you may not have considered all
preparations needed for CQE, which Adrian may have thought of in his
mq patch from his series (patch 3), but still.

Moreover, for reasons brought up while reviewing Adrian's series,
regarding if mq is "ready", and because I see that the diff for patch
12 is small, I suggest that we just skip the step adding a Kconfig
option to allow an opt-in of the mq path. In other words, *the* patch
that makes the switch to mq, should also remove the entire left over
of rubbish code, from the legacy request path. That's also what you do
in patch12, nice!

Finally, I understand that you would be happy to scrap this series,
but instead let Adrian's series, when re-posted, to go first. Could
you perhaps re-consider that, because I wonder if it may not be
smother and less risky, to actually apply everything up to patch 11 in
this series?

I noticed that you reported issues with card removal during I/O (for
both yours and Adrian's mq patch), but does those problems exists at
patch 11 - or is those explicitly introduced with the mk patch (patch
12)?

Of course, I realize that if we apply everything up to patch11, that
would require a massive re-base of Adrian's mq/CQE series, but on the
other hand, then matter which mq patch we decide to go with, it should
be a rather small diff, thus easy to review and less risky.

Adrian, Linus - what do you think?

Kind regards
Uffe
