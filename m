If we ever a read on the inode in question, we close the large-unit
context.  That's the simplest thing to do, since we then don't need to
track which blocks had been written from the inode.  And in general,
if you have a random read/write workload, large-unit contexts probably
won't help you.  We mainly would need this when the workload is doing
large sequential writes, which is *easy* to optimize for.

Right, so we only enable the large-unit context when we are in
ext4_da_writepages() and we can do the first write in a way that meets
the requirements (i.e., the write starts aligned on the erase block,
and is a multiple of the superpage size).  The moment we need to do a
read (see above) or a write which doesn't meet the large-unit
restrictions, we close the large-unit context.

(This is why I asked the question about whether there are performance
penalties for opening and closing contexts.  If it requires flushing
the NCQ queues, ala the trim request, then we might need to be more
careful.)

My assumption was that when you umount the drive, the file system
would close all of the contexts.

Yep.

Well, the high-end stoarge folks still would need to know if a set of
blocks being written are related.  The large-unit contexts might not
matter as much, but knowing that a set of writes *are* related is
something that would help them.
