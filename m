>From the SD host controller version 4.0 on, SDHCI implementation either
is version 3 compatible or version 4 mode. This patch-set covers those
changes which are common for SDHCI 4.0 version, regardless of whether
they are used with SD or eMMC storage devices.

This patchset also added a new sdhci driver for Spreadtrum's controller
which supports v4.0 mode.

This patchset has been tested on Spreadtrum's mobile phone, emmc can be
initialized, mounted, read and written, with these changes for common
sdhci framework and sdhci-sprd driver.

Changes from V2:
* Addressed comments from Adrian:
- Added sdhci_enable_v4_mode() for enabling v4 mode instead of determining by reading from registers;
- Added support for 64-bit SDMA address in v4 mode;
- Dropped the changes of ADMA2 data aglinment;
- Added support for "Auto Cmd Auto Select".
* Rebased on v4.18-rc2.
* Dealt with a few issues in sdhci-sprd:
- Save return value of mmc_of_parse();
- Add checking for clk_prepare_enable();
- Use BIT() macro instead.

Changes from v1:
* Addressed comments from Ulf:
 - Add dt-bindings for Spreadtrum sdhci;
 - Use assigned-clocks* DT bindings to set default source of sdio clock;
 - Removed unuseful print;
 - Removed two functions which are not used;
 - Add back the missing pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() after adding sdhci host.

* Changed Spreadtrum sdhci driver name to sdhci-sprd.
