I am not sure how that would work. It doesn't sound very effective to
me, but I may be wrong.

That would work...

...however this doesn't seem like a step in the direction we want to
take when porting to blkmq.

There will be an extra context switch for each an every request, won't there?

My point is, to be able to convert to blkmq, we must also avoid
performance regression - at leas as long as possible.

Right now, yes you are right. I hope soon not. :-)

These internal eMMC partitions are today suffering from the similar
problems as we have for mmc ioctls. That means, requests are being I/O
scheduled separately for each internal partition. Meaning requests for
one partition could starve requests for another.

I really hope we can fix this in some way or the other. Probably
building upon Linus Walleij's series for fixing the problems for mmc
ioctls [1] is the way to go.

Then, when we have managed to fix these issues, I think my approach
for extending the mmc_claim_host() API could be a possible
intermediate step when trying to complete the blkmq port. Then we can
continue to try to remove/re-work the claim host lock altogether as an
optimization task.

Kind regards
Uffe
