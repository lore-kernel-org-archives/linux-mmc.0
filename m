That is not entirely true.  We can pull requests by running the queue i.e.
blk_mq_run_hw_queues(q, false), returning BLK_MQ_RQ_QUEUE_BUSY and stopping
/ starting the queue as needed.

But, as I have written before, we could start with the most trivial
implementation.  ->queue_rq() puts the requests in a list and then the
thread removes them from the list.

That would be a good start because it would avoid having to deal with other
issues at the same time.

Aren't you overlooking the possibility that there are many block devices per
host. i.e. one per eMMC internal partition.
