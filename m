Right, that would work.

I think in the latter case, we actually want the database file to
be in its own context as well, to let the device know that it's
different from the other data that we send without a context.
Saugata just proposed on IRC that we could split the available
set of contexts into some that are used for linear access and
others that are used for random access. We can also make use
of POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL/POSIX_FADV_RANDOM in an application
to put a file into one of these categories.

As soon as we get into the territory of the file system being
smart about keeping separate contexts for some files rather than
just using the low bits of the inode number or the pid, we get
more problems:

* The block device needs to communicate the number of available
  contexts to the file system
* We have to arbitrate between contexts used on different partitions
  of the same device

Yes, makes sense.

My feeling is that we would actually benefit much more from the
erase block alignment than from the context for the large files.

There is one more option we have to give the best possible performance,
although that would be a huge amount of work to implement:

Any large file gets put into its own context, and we mark that
context "write-only" "unreliable" and "large-unit". This means the
file system has to write the file sequentially, filling one erase
block at a time, writing only "superpage" units (e.g. 16KB) or
multiples of that at once. We can neither overwrite nor read back
any of the data in that context until it is closed, and there is
no guarantee that any of the data has made it to the physical medium
before the context is closed. We are allowed to do read and write
accesses to any other context between superpage writes though.
After closing the context, the data will be just like any other
block again.

Right now, there is no support for large-unit context and also not for
read-only or write-only contexts, which means we don't have to
enforce strict policies and can basically treat the context ID
as a hint. Using the advanced features would require that we
keep track of the context IDs across partitions and have to flush
write-only contexts before reading the data again. If we want to
do that, we can probably discard the patch series and start over.

For eMMC and SD devices, it's available in the preferred_erase_size
sysfs attribute, but other devices don't have that. What we've also
discussed in the past is to make that size available to the
I/O scheduler in order to implement a way to flush out all writes
for a given erase block at once, because that essentially comes
for free once we do the first write into that erase block.

That value would have to be user-selectable though, and we need
to come up with a way to do that for partitioned devices. While it
would be nice for ext4 to be able to set the property of the
block device based on the superblock data, that would fail as soon
as we have multiple partitions with conflicting settings.

Yes, very much so.

I think this is something we can do in the Linaro storage team.
We actually have plans to also put the erase block size in the swap
header, so we should be able to use the same code in mke2fs and mkswap,
and potentially others. What we discussed in the storage team meeting
today is that we start out by making ext4 aware of the erase block
size through the superblock and aligning extents for large files to
erase block boundaries.

If that works out well, the second step would be to detect which small
files are use a random-write pattern and group them in erase blocks
that are distinct from erase blocks for linear-write files.
