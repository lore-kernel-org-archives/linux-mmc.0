Note that there are already the s_raid_stride and s_raid_stripe_width,
used by the ext4 allocator to align the start and size of allocations
on RAID systems.  The erase block size would be like s_raid_stride
(the minimum amount of data to allocate and write contiguously).

I don't know that there is a benefit to having a separate erase block
size, since in the end it means the same as s_raid_stride to the
allocator - make sure allocations/writes are aligned and sized on
multiples of this.

Cheers, Andreas
