You are attacking your most valuable resource, a reviewer.

And I even said the patch looks good.

The only thing you attain with this kind of langauge is alienante
me and discourage others to review your patch set. You also
give your employer a bad name, since you are representing
them.

I understand it can be tough to deal with review comments
and it can make you loose your temper when people (sometimes
even the same person!) say contradictory things.

But in hindsight, don't you think these 5 last lines of your message
had been enough without that first line?
