I'm glad you have found that i_mutex really is needed here: it had
worried me that it was not taken, but I could only raise a concern,
didn't really know one way or the other.

Note that this is wrong, but there is no reason why it should be you
to fix it in this patchset.  Blocks may have been fallocated beyond
i_size, and they should be removed when a hole is punched there.

It's on the ext4 TODO list to be fixed, so don't worry about it:
unless your changes happen to make it trivial to fix at the same time.

It's not clear to me why that's now safe to remove: a little more comment
in the commit would be good; but so long as it's clear to ext4 developers,
don't try to make it clear to me - that would take far too long!
