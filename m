I don't think that is correct. The most obvious implementation in eMMC
hardware for this would be to group all data from one context to be
written into the same erase block, in order to reduce the amount
of garbage collection that needs to happen at erase time. AFAICT,
the main interest here is, as Ted is guessing correctly, to make sure
that all data which gets written into one context has roughly the
same life time before it gets erased or overwritten.

That is of course the defined behavior of a block device that does
not change with the use of contexts. To get the best performance,
a random-write database file would always reside in a context by itself
and not get mixed with long-lived write-once data. If we have a way
in the file system to tell whether a file is written linearly or randomly
(e.g. by looking at the O_APPEND or O_CREAT flag), it might make sense
to split the context space accordingly.

One suggestion that has been made before was to base the context on
the process ID rather than the inode number, but that has many other
problems, e.g. when the same file gets written by multiple processes.
