OK to be clear, correct, it is set by that system call.

And as far as I can tell there is exactly one program in the world that issues
that syscall, and that is ionice(1).

It is described to the world as a way for users to give hints to the
I/O scheduler
about how to manage requests. For example a user can hint that some IO
is a backup job and not important and some IO is a media player and really
important.

And since the block layer only handles this hint in the legacy blk CFQ scheduler
I want to know from the block layer developers if this priority has any future.
BFQ does not use this hint at all, I think Paolo described the ionice command
as problematic, and we need to understand if user-provided IO scheduling hints
is something that is going to be used in the future.
