My understanding is that once we do that, we have already won much more
than we can by using contexts, because we get perfect write patterns.
The only thing that contexts would still buy us is that the device has
more freedom to cache things separately in each context if we write
with less than superpage alignment.

Is the mballoc algorithm you describe something that is already implemented
with the semantics you describe, or is there something we need to change
still, e.g. making sure that all allocations are aligned to the stripe-width?
