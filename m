You are probably right about this, but it makes no sense to me.

I don't understand why the queue_depth, stated by storage device, has
to do with the number of requests being available for I/O scheduling.

I have looped in Jens and Paolo (BFQ), perhaps they can help to spread
some more light on this.

Yeah it does, again thanks!
