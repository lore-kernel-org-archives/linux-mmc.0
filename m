Well the CQE patches already do that.

I can make a few more comments about what else is broken.  Have you tried
suspend / resume?  At a glance, it looks like you are trying to use
blk_stop_queue() which is not a blk-mq function.

No.  We just expect to base everything on mainline.

IMHO BFQ is just another example of unnecessary delay.

It has nothing to do with pressure.  It is about what is reasonable.
Features should go in as soon as they are ready.  Ideally queued up in the
same release cycle they are submitted.  If the code doesn't work right, then
it can't go in straight away, but fake reasons for delaying things needs to
stop.
