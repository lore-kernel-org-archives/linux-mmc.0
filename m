IIUC there is a task in blk-mq submitting the requests, and that goes
all the way to starting it on the host. Then as an interrupt comes back
I kick the worker and that reports back to the block layer. So that
is one task switch per request and then one switch back to the MQ
layer.

But I am experimenting as we speak to get rid of the worker
for all simple cases that don't require retune or BKOPS and that's
pretty cool if it can be made to work :)

Right! Nice catch.

I will update the patch and put that in the struct mmc_async_req so
it survives the retry rounds.

You seem to have an either/or stance.

Mine if more of a both/and.

It is not even necessary to have one set of these patches on
top of each other, they can also be mixed in some order.

A lot of factors influence this I think, like structure of code and
maintainability, performance, block layer interaction semantics,
etc etc.

We definately need input from Ulf and Bartlomiej (who was actually
the first to work on MQ for MMC/SD).

You do come across as a bit hard-headed.

But I think it is better to focus on the code per se.

I would suggest we go and review each others patch series to
learn from each codebase what was done in a good way for the
MMC/SD stack and what was not, you tossed out a nice review
comment above for example.

We are in violent agreement.

I take it that you are working on ChromeOS context and that since
they have this policy, they, through their influence over Intel as a
supplier is putting heavy pressure on you personally to get this
merged.

Is that correctly understood?

That would explain your increasing pushing to get this
upstream pretty well, especially if you have tech leads and
managers hovering over your shoulder every week asking how
the CQE upstream work is progressing.

It is indeed tough to juggle this with the pressure to "upstream
first" the BFQ scheduler policy that we are working on in Linaro
to increase interactivity. We need to enable this on devices
pronto and that means migrating MMC/SD to MQ and MQ only.
I have shared this motivation since the start, so it should come
as no surprise.

So I also have some pressure to "Get This Feature In Now".

Yours,
Linus Walleij
