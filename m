What about the other restrictions I mentioned though? If we use large-unit
read-only contexts, it's not just about writing the entire erase block
from start to end, we have to make sure we follow other rules:

* We cannot read from write-only large-unit context, so we have to
  do one of these:
   a) ensure we never drop any pages from page-cache between writing
      them to the large context and closing that context
   b) if we need to read some data that we have just written to the
      large-unit context, close that context and open a new rw-context
      without the large-unit flag set (or write in the default context)
* All writes to the large-unit context have to be done in superpage
  size, which means something between 8 and 32 kb typically, so more
  than the underlying fs block size
* We can only start the large unit at the start of an erase block. If
  we unmount the drive and later continue writing, it has to continue
  without the large-unit flag at first until we hit an erase block
  boundary.
* If we run out of contexts in the block device, we might have to
  close a large-unit context before getting to the end of it.

My impression was always that the high-end storage folks try to make
everything behave nicely whatever the access patterns are, and they
can do it because an SSD controllers has vast amounts of cache (megabytes,
not kilobytes) and processing power (e.g. 1Ghz ARMv5 instead of 50 Mhz
8051) to handle it, and they also make use of tagged command queuing to
let the device have multiple outstanding requests.
