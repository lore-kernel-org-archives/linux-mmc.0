This is very similar to what was implemented in mballoc preallocation.
Large files will get their own preallocation context, while small files
would share a context (i.e. an 8MB extent) and be packed densely into
this extent to avoid seeking.  It wouldn't be unreasonable to just give
each mballoc context a different eMMC context.
