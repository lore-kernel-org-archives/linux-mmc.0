Hi Damien,
actually I have followed threads on SMR device, and have already looked
into this.  I'm sorry for not having mentioned it in my first reply.

My plan is to simply port this feature from mq-deadline to bfq.  It
should be really straightforward, especially after the testing you did
through mq-deadline.  Even if I'm missing some less trivial hidden
issue, I guess it won't be impossible to address.

If it may be useful for the outcome of this thread, I'm willing to
raise the priority of this change to bfq.

Until bfq simply handles SMR devices too.

Thanks,
