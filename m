Yes, the idea is to group the read, write requests for a file to a
common context so that MMC can optimize the performance.

There is no restriction on the number of blocks which can be added in
the context. However, MMC restricts the number of contexts to 15. So,
potentially, multiple file system contexts will map to single MMC
context.

In this patch, context is used at file level based on inode number.
So, in the above example, multiple contexts will be used for the
directory, file updates during RPM installation.

There is no restriction that related blocks within the MMC context
needs to be deleted together

MMC context allows the data blocks to be overwritten or randomly access=

This context mechanism will be used on both UFS and MMC devices. If
there are some alternate suggestions on what can be used as context
from file system perspective, then please  suggest.
