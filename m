That is correct (though the measured effect is small).

However when we switch to MQ it must happen like this due to its asynchronous
nature of issuing requests to us.

Then we have MQ's submission thread coming in from one en and our worker
to manage retries and errors on the other side. We obviously cannot do
the retries and resends in MQs context as it blocks subsequent requests.

I looked at that and couldn't find a good way to get to that point.

Mainly because of mmc_start_bkops() that may
arbitrarily fire after every command and start new requests to the
card, and that of course require a process context to happen. Then there
is the retune thing that I do not fully understand how it schedules, but
it might be fine since I'm under the impression that it is done at the
start of the next request if need be. Maybe both can be overcome by
quick checks in IRQ context and then this can be done. (I'm not smart enough
to see that yet, sorry.)

However since we activate the blocking context in MQ I don't know
if it can even deal with having requests completed in interrupt context
so that the next thing that happens after completing the request and
returning from the interrupt is that the block layer thread gets scheduled
(unless something more important is going on), I guess it is possible?
It looks like it could be really efficient.

I think Jens provided a patch for this bug (don't see the patch
upstream though).
