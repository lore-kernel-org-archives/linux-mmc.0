Hello,

I'm using Hynix eMMC4.41 with Linux kernel 3.4.5.

After mounting ext4 partition /userdata with 'discard' mount option enabled,
fs triggers TRIM commands to eMMC after every file deletion. With this
setup, for a continuous reboot test (5s awake and issue reboot and repeat)
with 10 or 20 iterations, i see data corruption in eMMC consistently.

mount options are :- noatime,nosuid,nodev,noauto_da_alloc,discard
encryptable="path"

What am i missing here? if 'discard' mount option is removed, then no data
corruption in eMMC for more than 200 iterations. Does TRIM needs some extra
care? BKOPS is not enabled in eMMC (is bkops mandatory if using TRIM?)
Apologies, if this is not proper platform to ask such question. Please guide
and throw some light.

Thanks,
Prasanna NAVARATNA
