When using DMA, if the DMA addr spans 128MB boundary, we have to split
the DMA transfer into two so that each one doesn't exceed the boundary.

patch1 adds adma_table_num to struct sdhci_host so that driver can
control the ADMA table number.
patch2 introduces adma_write_desc() hook to struct sdhci_ops so that
driver can override it.
patch3 finally solves the 128MB boundary limitation.

since v1:
  - fix BOUNDARY_OK macro if addr+len is aligned to 128MB
  - use DIV_ROUND_UP to cal extra desc num
  - fix !len for dwcmshc_adma_write_desc()

  mmc: sdhci: add adma_table_num member to struct sdhci_host
  mmc: sdhci: introduce adma_write_desc() hook to struct sdhci_ops
  mmc: sdhci-of-dwcmshc: solve 128MB DMA boundary limitation
