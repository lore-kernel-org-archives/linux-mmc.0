Neil Brown's article on LWN points to Ming Lei's patch
set:
https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1513023.html

As addressing the issue that held back blk-MQ from
being default for SCSI, and it is reportedly to be
queued for v4.15. Since this MMC/SD rework is
also targeted for v4.15 I think we can assume it is
pretty much ready for everything, and delete the
non-MQ block path.

I just haven't seen any of this problem in my tests
with MMC/SD so I do not think it would be affected,
but it anyways seem to be fixed.

OK maybe I am especially optimistic. But it's not just
based on that.

Yours,
