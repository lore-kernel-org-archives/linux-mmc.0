Hmm. But that would amount to implement yet another queuing mechanism
within the driver/mmc subsystem, wouldn't it?

Which is, incidentally, the same method the S/390 DASD driver uses
nowadays; report an arbitrary queue depth to the block layer and queue
all requests internally to better saturate the device.

However I'd really like to get rid of this, and tweak the block layer to
handle these cases.

One idea I had was to use a 'prep' function for mq; it would be executed
once the request is added to the queue.
Key point here is that 'prep' and 'queue_rq' would be two distinct
steps; the driver could do all required setup functionality during
'prep', and then do the actual submission via 'queue_rq'.
That would allow to better distribute the load for timing-sensitive
devices, and with a bit of luck remove the need for a separate queuing
inside the driver.

In any case, it looks like a proper subject for LSF/MM...
Linus? Arnd? Are you up for it?

Cheers,

Hannes
