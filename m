MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY is necessary because it means that a data transfer
request has finished when the host controller calls mmc_request_done(). i.e.
polling the card is not necessary.

Have you tried V9 or V10.  There was a fix in V9 related to calling
->post_req() which could mess up DMA.

The other thing that could go wrong with DMA is if it cannot accept
->post_req() being called from mmc_request_done().
