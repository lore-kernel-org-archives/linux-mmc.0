Needs some rework.

   all have something to say about invalidatepage().  I should think
   you can leave the netfs-api.txt one alone, but the other two ought
   now to comment on invalidatepage_range() too.  Can perfectly well be
   left to a separate patch, following on a little later if you prefer.

Okay, fine, that fits with patch 06 where the third arg is endoffset.

Length?  No, patch 06 is passing endoffset.

So here you are adding together two offsets.

And this is weird, even if length were a length: though such wraparound
is conceivable, a far more likely overflow would be stop > PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.

Disillusioned, I didn't stop to think about this one.

See comments on fs.h.

It may turn out to be bad advice, given how invalidatepage() already
takes an unsigned long, but I'd be tempted to make both of these args
unsigned int, since that helps to make it clearer that they're intended
to be offsets within a page, in the range 0..PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.

(partial_start, partial_end and top in truncate_inode_pages_range()
are all unsigned int.)

Andrew is very keen on naming arguments in prototypes,
and I think there is an especially strong case for it here.

Likewise; ah, good, you named them... but then passed the wrong thing.

Good.

Not so good.

So if a filesystem were to declare both invalidatepage_range() and
invalidatepage(), it would call them both?  That seems odd, and differs
from what you said in the commit message, though probably would not matter.

Patches 02-05 look as if they suffer from the same defect;
I didn't look at the later ones, they may well be unaffected.

I can see that your series would change less if we were declare that
01 is right and 06 is wrong; but I find consistency with zero_user_segment
too appealing, and the strange "stop" stuff here too unappealing.
