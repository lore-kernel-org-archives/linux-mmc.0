(I wonder if linux-mmc@vger.kernel.org was supposed to be
linux-mm@kvack.org?  Our apologies to linux-mmc if so.)

(tmpfs also supports punch hole, but has its own truncation routine,
and does not need to get involved in these changes.)

Thanks for the reminder.  I'm happy with the general direction, if not
some of the details; though I see it as more of a vfs than an mm thing.

I'll comment briefly now on patch 06 (which is fine) and patch 01 (which
is not) and patch 07 (which is outside my scope, but worth a remark on).

I won't attempt to judge whether the ext4 and ocfs2 and xfs parts
are correct; but from the look of it, 02 03 04 05 are wrong like 01
(or you can say it's 06 which is wrong, though it looks good to me).
