OK! Performance is paramount, so this indeed confirms that we need
to re-engineer the MMC/SD stack to not rely on this kthread to "drive"
transactions, instead we need to complete them quickly from the driver
callbacks and let MQ drive.

A problem here is that issueing the requests are in blocking context
while completion is in IRQ context (for most drivers) so we need to
look into this.

That seems more or less confirmed by my dd-test in the commit
message. sys time is really small with the simple time+dd tests.

Awesome.

I think we can hash it out, we just need to rewrite the MMC/SD
core request handling a bit.
