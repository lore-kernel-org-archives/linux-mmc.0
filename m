Let's not forget that, in almost all cases, filesystem images are not 
created live on the final medium.  Factories are picking a batch of 
flash devices and a pre-built filesystem image is stamped on them, and 
there might not even be a guarantee that those flash devices will all 
have the same characteristics.  So to say that making this tuning at 
mkfs time is probably not the best strategy.
