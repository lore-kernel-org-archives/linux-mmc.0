Only MQ.

I don't agree that holding up features for years and years is an ideal outcome.

When the host controller supports asynchronous requests, it should be the
same, but as I wrote on the cover message, the block layer workqueue had
worse latency than a dedicated thread.  It seems that is related to it being
bound to a CPU.

Asynchronous requests are completed in the ->done() callback.

It is not exactly accurate to say that requests can be issued in parallel.
eMMC/SD cards can only do one thing at a time.  Asynchronous requests
facilitate the driver to prepare the next request without first having to
wait for the previous request.

The new patches have support for asynchronous requests and, consequently,
the preparation of the next request before waiting for the previous request.
 There is no need for another execution path.
