To NAND-flash based storage device, such as eMMC card, it's possible that the REQ_META tag can be used to notify the low level eMMC card - 'Hi, the following data is important meta data, it should be stored into some more reliable area of the NAND flash media'. For example, stored the meta data into SLC NAND partition/area inside of the eMMC card. Of course, it depends on the card vendor's implementation.

Thanks a lot for the suggestions. I'm not sure whether they're feasible, but will look into it and do more investigations.

Thanks.
