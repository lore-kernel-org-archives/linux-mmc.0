As I said, it's not a technical limitation, but a logical conclusion
from trying to use the context ID for something useful. The only
reason to use context ID in the first place is to reduce the amount
of garbage collection in the device (improving performance and expected
life of the device), so any context ID annotations we make should be
directed at giving useful information to the device to actually do that.
