So why change it in this patch?

No matter you like it or not, the legacy request error path is what we got now.

The way forward is not to just through it away and start over, but
instead to take small steps and make parts useful also for blkmq.

Yes, it's more work, but on the other hand, small changes which moves
things in the right direction are also more easy to review.

So, no, sorry, I don't buy it!

On this version, I spent a few hours on it, but really, it isn't easy
to look at ~1000 new lines in one single patch, especially changes
that re-implements the entire mmc request layer.

Yes, the new code is simpler, but as stated, re-factoring some of the
old code that can be re-used, is the way forward.

These checks are being done also in the legacy path, so in principle
adding these and not using them there, means open-coding to me.

Let me try to make this more clear then.

This is about keeping patches reviewable and about making one change per patch.

More precisely, move all code related to MMC_CAP_DIRECT_COMPLETE (the
new cap which you introduce in this patch), into a separate patch on
top of this one. That makes it both easy to review this patch, but
also the one that introduces the new cap.

Yes, but this boils done to that I am not sure what
blk_mq_quiesce_queue() really means from dispatching point of view.

Would it possible that a dispatched request became preempted just
before we was about to call mmc_claim_host() for it, thus the above
mmc_claim_host() claims the host before?

Are you sure that can't happen?

See above.

Sorry, I haven't looked closely enough at the PM support. Obviously my bad.

Adrian, I have appreciated your contributions to mmc under a very long
time, and I still am. I don't doubt your expertise in the area!

However, it seems like you don't want to listen to peoples opinions
regarding this series - and I really don't get what's the deal. A man
of your skills should easily be able to address those comments, but
you have mostly been arguing and chosen to ignore them.

As long as I have something to say in this community, I will never
accept poorly written patches, at least that goes for the mmc core
layer.

That said, if other people think are better suited than me, please go
ahead and make a formal suggestion.

Kind regards
Uffe
