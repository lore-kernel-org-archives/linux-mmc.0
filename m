Hi,

I may have some silly queries here. Please bear with my little 
understanding on blk-mq.

Could you please confirm on this- does even the HW/SW CMDQ in emmc would 
use only 1 hardware queue with (say ~31) as queue depth, of that HW 
queue? Is this understanding correct?

Or will it be possible to have more than 1 HW Queue with lesser queue 
depth per HW queue?

I understand that the block drivers are moving to blk-mq framework.
But keeping that reason apart, do we also anticipate any theoretical 
performance gains in moving mmc driver to blk-mq framework  - for both 
in case of legacy emmc, and SW/HW CMDQ in emmc ? And by how much?

It would be even better to know if adding of scheduler to blk-mq will 
make any difference in perf gains or not in this case?

Do we any rough estimate or study on that?
This is only out of curiosity and for information purpose.

Ritesh
