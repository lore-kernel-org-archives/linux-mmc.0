Sure, that just means there needs to be a way of overriding the values
used by mke2fs.  (Because as you create the fs image, the storage
device parameters may make a difference to how blocks get allocated.)

The reason why I talk about making it work automatically at mke2fs
time is that the vast majority of created file systems (where a
specially created fs by a handset vendor counts as "one", even if it
then gets stamped on millions of devices), the end user is someone
naive/oblivious, so the right thing *has* to happen by default in the
common case of running mke2fs on the storage device where the file
system gets used.
