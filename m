Well, using the lower 4 bits of the inode number has an even higher chance
of putting stuff in the same category that does not belong there.
E.g. if you write 1000 small files in a row, they are likely to be
in just one directory, or a small number of directories, but using the
inode number as the context ID, we end up spreading them over all 15
contexts even though it would be appropriate to have them all in the
same one.

I agree that using the process as an indication would be nice, but
I could not come up with a way to ensure that we use the same
context ID if two processes are writing to the same file.

I think ideally we would also want to write small files separately from
large files in the file system, and that would also make support for
contexts less useful.

For any large (sufficiently larger than erasesize) files, it would also
be nice if the extents were aligned on erase block boundaries. Again,
if we do this, using context annotations should have no benefit over
just using the default context.

For eMMC at least the erase block size is information that we should
be able to figure out. While I've seen devices that are lying there,
the representatives of the eMMC manufactures that I talked to basically
agreed that we should take the provided information to be correct
and if it happens to be wrong, that should be considered a firmware
bug that may result in bad performance and should be fixed in the
next version.

For SD cards, almost everyone is lying and we cannot trust the
information, and for USB flash, there is no way to ask the device.
In both of these cases, we probably want to detect the erase block
size at mkfs time using some timing attack that I worked on before.
Note that those devices also do not offer support for context IDs.
