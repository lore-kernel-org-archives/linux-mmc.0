So I guess currently something takes a host lock and then performs the
5 requests.

Thus we need to send a single custom request containing a list of 5
things to do, and return after that.

Or do you mean that we return to userspace inbetween these different
requests and the sequencing is done in userspace?

I hope not because that sounds fragile, like userspace could crash and
leave the host lock dangling :/
