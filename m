The problem with trying to manage the SDIO case as a specific case, it
that it is the same work (mmc_rescan()) that runs to detect any kind
of removable card.

Moreover, it's not until the card has been fully detected and
initialized, when we can realize what kind of card it is.

Perhaps we can re-factor the hole mmc_rescan() thing so there is one
part that can be run only to detect new cards being inserted in
lockless fashion, while another part could deal with the
polling/removal - which then perhaps could be different depending on
the card type.

Not sure if this helps...

It looks hairy, but please have a try!

In the meantime, I will wrap my head around and try to see if we can
find a possible easier intermediate step.

Kind regards
