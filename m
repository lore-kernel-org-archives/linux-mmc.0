Hmm, In theory the card-detect work queue should not be active
at the same time as any I/O, but I see you point. Could the card-detect
wq perhaps also use the blk queue for sending a special request that
triggers the detection logic?

Alternatively, I had this idea that we could translate blk requests into
mmc commands and then have a (short fixed length) set of outstanding
mmc commands in the device that always get done in order. The card
detect and the user space I/O would then directly put mmc commands
onto the command queue, as would the blk-mq scheduler. You
still need a lock to access that command queue, but the mmc host
would just always pick the next command off the list when one
command completes.
This also lets you integrate packed commands: if the next outstanding
command is the same type as the request coming in from blk-mq,
you can merge it into a single mmc command to be submitted
together, otherwise it gets deferred.
