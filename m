No, there is no dependency on MMC_MQ_DEFAULT.

No, there is no dependency on MMC_MQ_DEFAULT.

Seems like a very strange question. Obviously CQHCI has to be configured
after suspend.

Also please don't confuse CQE and CQHCI.  CQHCI is an implementation of a
CQE.  We currently do not expect to have another implementation, but it is
not impossible.

That is how it works!  The host controller has to decide how to handle
suspend / resume.

cqhci_suspend() / cqhci_resume() are helper functions that the host
controller can use, but doesn't have to.

Special accessors can be used to fix up registers that don't work exactly
the way the standard specified.

They are nothing to do with CQE or mmc ops.  These are for hosts that have a
CQHCI compatible CQE.

Ok so you are not understanding this at all.

As a CQE implementation, CQHCI interfaces with the upper layers through the
CQE ops etc.

But CQHCI also has to work with any host controller driver, so it needs an
interface for that, which is what cqhci_host_ops is for.  All the ops serve
useful purposes.

The whole point is to prove a library that can work with any host controller
driver.  That means it must provide functions and callbacks.

Nothing to do with CQE.  This is CQHCI.  Please try to get the difference.

Yeah, so CQHCI is just one of theoretically any number of CQE
implementations.  This has nothing to do with the core.  It is entirely up
to the host driver.  cqhci_pltfm_init() allows the mmio space to be defined
by platform resources, whereas cqhci_init() does all the rest of the
initialization.
