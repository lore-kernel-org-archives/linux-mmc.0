Linus, Adrian,

Apologize for sidetracking the discussion, just wanted to add some
minor comments.

Actually the get / puts for runtime PM of the card is already done
taking the host->claim_cnt into account.

In other words, the additional in-flight counter does not provide an
additional improvement in this regards.

For that reason, perhaps the in-flight counter should be added in the
CQE patch instead, because it seems like it is there it really
belongs?

Well, it's not an easy decision, simply because it moves the code in
an even worse situation maintenance wise. So, if you guys just
suddenly have to move on to do something else, then it becomes my
problem to work out. :-)

However, as I trust both of you, and that you seems to agree on the
path forward, I am fine keeping the old code for while.

Although, please make sure the Kconfig option starts out by being
enabled by default, so we can get some test coverage of the mq path.

Of course, then we need to work on the card removal problem asap, and
hopefully we manage to fix them. If not, or other strange errors
happens, we would need to change the default value to 'n' of the
Kconfig.

Can you please make this improvement as a standalone patch on top of
the mq patch?

I think that would be good, because it points out some generic
problems with mq, which we then, at least short term, tries to address
locally in MMC.

Yes, please. However, I will as stated, be withholding that change for
a while, until we fixed any showstoppers in the mq path.

Kind regards
