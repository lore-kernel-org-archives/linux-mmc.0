This set of patches are aimed to allow truncate_inode_pages_range() handle
ranges which are not aligned at the end of the page. Currently it will
hit BUG_ON() when the end of the range is not aligned. Punch hole feature
however can benefit from this ability saving file systems some work not
forcing them to implement their own invalidate code to handle unaligned
ranges.

In order for this to work we need however new address space operation
invalidatepage_range which should be able to handle page invalidation with
offset and length specified.

patch 01:	Implements the new invalidatepage_range address space
		operation in the mm layer
patch 02 - 05:	Wire the new invalidatepage_range aop to the ext4, xfs and
		ocfs2 file system (which are currently the only file
		systems supporting punch hole) and implement this
		functionality for jbd2 as well.
patch 06:	Change truncate_inode_pages_range() to handle unaligned
		ranges.
patch 07 - 15:	Ext4 specific changes which take benefit from the
		previous truncate_inode_pages_range() change. Not all
		are realated specifically to this change, but all are
		related to the punch hole feature.

Thanks!
