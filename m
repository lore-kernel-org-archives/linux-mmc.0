Yeah, it's easy, for file systems (like ext4) which have delayed
allocation.  It's always faster to write in large contiguous chunks,
so we do a lot of work to make sure we can make that happen.  Take a
look of a blktrace of ext4 when writing large set of files; most of
the I/O will be in contiguous, large chunks.  So it's just a matter of
telling the block device layer when we are about to do that large
write.  We could probably do some tuning to make the chunks be larger
and adjust some parameters in the block allocation, but that's easy.

One thing which is going to be tricky is that ext4 currently uses a
buddy allocator, so it will work well for erase blocks of two.  You
mentioned some devices might have erase block sizes of 3*2**N, so that
might require reworking the block allocator some, if we need to align
writes on erase block boundaries.

I'm not aware that anything has been announced, but this is one of
those things which the high end folks have *got* to be thinking about.
The issues involved aren't only just for eMMC, you know...   :-)
