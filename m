Yes. That's where I fixed it up mostly.

Partly true.

Adrian also pointed out the rubbishness of the error handling code
in the old stack, and my patch set does *not* fix that. It is also a part
of his patch set I like very much and a reason why I would prefer to
use Adrian's patches if possible.

We have the following risk factors:

- Observed performance degradation of 1% (on x86 SDHI I guess)
- The kernel crashes if SD card is removed (both patch sets)
- The risk of something nasty happening we don't know of

This is possible.

But I think it is preferred to proceed with Adrian's patches.
I really like the looks of the code. He says he's coming back with
a set that also kills off the old block layer, and I am pretty
positive I will just ACK the whole thing.

I optimistically think we can jointly fix the card removal issue
and possible also mitigate or root-cause the performance
degradation observed by Adrian

In the best of worlds, Ming Lei's patches will just fix this too
(we'll see, we can probably get a branch from the block people
to try it) else we can use tracing and perf to drill into it I guess.

I tested it and it is present earlier in the series. I would have to
revisit and hash it out.

At this point I would prefer to use Adrian's series. He has explained
pretty well his reasoning and when I tested the code it was performing
well. I have some outstanding thingies, but this I can just as well do
on top of his patches.
