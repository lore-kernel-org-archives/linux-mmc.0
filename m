In the end I guess the only thing to do is to compare the patchsets to
see how the result would look like. :-)

My current observation is that our current implementation of the mmc
block device and corresponding mmc queue, is still rather messy, even
if you and Linus recently has worked hard to improve the situation.

Moreover it looks quite different compared to other block device
drivers and in the way of striving to make it more robust and
maintainable, that's not good.

Therefore, I am not really comfortable with replacing one mmc hack for
block device management with yet another, as that seems to be what
your approach would do - unless I am mistaken of course.

Instead I would like us to move into a more generic blk device
approach. Whatever that means. :-)

You are right!

However, in my comparison I was thinking of how it *can* work if we
were able to submit/prepare request in the context of the caller.

Yes, starting simple is always good!

Although, even if simple, we need to stop adding more mmc specific
hacks into the mmc block device layer.
