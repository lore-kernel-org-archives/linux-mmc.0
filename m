I'm not sure if I really understand the difference between the two.
Do you mean optimization A makes sure that you don't have partial
pages at the start of a request, while optimization B also splits
small requests on page boundary if the first page in it is aligned?

Just to make sure: Did you properly align the partition start on an
erase block boundary of 4MB?

I would have loved to see results with nilfs2 and btrfs as well, but
I can understand that these were less relevant to you, especially
since you don't really want to compare the file systems as much as
your own changes.

One very surprising result to me is how much worse the ext4 numbers
are compared to ext2/ext3. I would have guessed that they should
be much better, given that the ext4 developers are specifically
trying to optimize for this case. I've taken the ext4 mailing
list on Cc here and will forward your test results there as
well.

I suppse when the result is total runtime in seconds, that larger numbers
are always worse, so I agree.

One potential flaw in the measurement might be that running the test
a second time means that the card is already in a state that requires
garbage collection and therefore slower. Running the test in the opposite
order (optimized first, then unoptimized) might theoretically lead
to other results. It's not clear from your description whether your
test method has taken this into account (I would assume yes).

The quirks patch still looks fine to me, I'd just recommend that we
don't apply it before we have a need for it, i.e. at least a single
card specific quirk.
