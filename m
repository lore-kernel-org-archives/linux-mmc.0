Note that mballoc was specifically designed to handle allocation requests that are aligned on RAID stripe boundaries, so it should be able to handle this for MMC as well.  What is needed is to tell the filesystem what the underlying alignment is.  That can be done at format time with mke2fs or afterward with tune2fs by using the "-E stripe_width" option.
