There is the latency for the worker that runs mmc_finalize_areq() and then
another latency to wake up the worker that is running mmc_start_areq().
That is 2 wake-ups instead of 1.

As a side note, ideally we would be able to issue the next request from the
interrupt or soft interrupt context of the completion (i.e. 0 wake-ups
between requests), but we would probably have to look at the host API to
support that.

The last time I looked at the blk-mq I/O scheduler code, it pulled up to
qdepth requests from the I/O scheduler and left them on a local list while
running ->queue_rq().  That means blocking in ->queue_rq() leaves some
number of requests in limbo (not issued but also not in the I/O scheduler)
for that time.

Maybe blk-mq should offer a pull interface to I/O scheduler users?
