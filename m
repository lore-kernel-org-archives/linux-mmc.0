I have looked over the code, I was unable to find a good mergebase to apply
it on (I guess it is based on linux-next at some date in the past) so mostly
I just looked at it overall, and I can solidly say that this patch series:

Acked-by: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>

I gave some more explicit review on some initial patches that I think
should go in as fixes.

I do not expect it to perform any less than the previous iteration on my
systems where it was already performing well and Bartlomiej also has
confirmed that the patch set works for him.

Ulf: I suggest this be applied (+/- some rebasing) early for v4.15.

I am positively convinced that we can make things work on top of this.

Fully acceptable I think.

Also acceptable I think.

I agree.
