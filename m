This switches the MMC/SD stack over to unconditionally
using the multiqueue block interface for block access.
This modernizes the MMC/SD stack and makes it possible
to enable BFQ scheduling on these single-queue devices.

This is the v4 version of this v3 patch set from february:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-mmc&m=148665788227015&w=2

The patches are available in a git branch:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linusw/linux-stericsson.git/log/?h=mmc-mq-v4.14-rc4

You can pull it to a clean kernel tree like this:
git checkout -b mmc-test v4.14-rc4
git pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linusw/linux-stericsson.git mmc-mq-v4.14-rc4

I have now worked on it for more than a year. I was side
tracked to clean up some code, move request allocation to
be handled by the block layer, delete bounce buffer handling
and refactoring the RPMB support. With the changes to request
allocation, the patch set is a better fit and has shrunk
from 16 to 12 patches as a result.

It is still quite invasive. Yet it is something I think would
be nice to merge for v4.16...

The rationale for this approach was Arnd's suggestion to try to
switch the MMC/SD stack around so as to complete requests as
quickly as possible when they return from the device driver
so that new requests can be issued. We are doing this now:
the polling loop that was pulling NULL out of the request
queue and driving the pipeline with a loop is gone with
the next-to last patch ("block: issue requests in massive
parallel"). This sets the stage for MQ to go in and hammer
requests on the asynchronous issuing layer.

We use the trick to set the queue depth to 2 to get two
parallel requests pushed down to the host. I tried to set this
to 4, the code survives it, the queue just have three items
waiting to be submitted all the time.

In my opinion this is also a better fit for command queueuing.
Handling command queueing needs to happen in the asynchronous
submission codepath, so instead of waiting on a pending
areq, we just stack up requests in the command queue.

It sounds simple but I bet this drives a truck through Adrians
patch series. Sorry. :(

We are not issueing new requests from interrupt context: I still
have to post a work on a workqueue for it. Since there is the
retune and background operations that need to be checked after
every command and yeah, it needs to happen in blocking context
as far as I know.

I might make a hack trying to strip out the retune (etc) and
instead run request until something fail and report requests
back to the block layer in interrupt context. It would be an
interesting experiment, but for later.

We have parallelism in pre/post hooks also with multiqueue.
All asynchronous optimization that was there for the old block
layer is now also there for multiqueue.

Last time I followed up with some open questions
https://marc.info/?l=linux-mmc&m=149075698610224&w=2
I think these are now resolved.

As a result, the last patch is no longer in RFC state. I
think this works. (Famous last words, OK there WILL be
regressions but hey, we need to do this.)
You can see there are three steps:

- I do some necessary refactoring and need to move postprocessing
  to after the requests have been completed. This clearly, as you
  can see, introduce a performance regression in the dd test with
  the patch:
  "mmc: core: move the asynchronous post-processing"
  It seems the random seek with find isn't much affected.

- I continue the refactoring and get to the point of issueing
  requests immediately after every successful transfer, and the
  dd performance is restored with patch
  "mmc: queue: issue requests in massive parallel"

- Then I add multiqueue on top of the cake. So before the change
  we have the nice performance we want so we can study the effect
  of just introducing multiqueueing in the last patch
  "mmc: switch MMC/SD to use blk-mq multiqueueing v4"

margin.
