This would have to be rebased as Ulf merged my patch making this
a per-host runtime config option. (The Kconfig is gone for example.)

Bounce buffers were added by Pierre Ossman for kernel 2.6.23 in
commit 98ccf14909ba02a41c5925b0b2c92aeeef23d3b9
"mmc: bounce requests for simple hosts"

Quote:

    Some hosts cannot do scatter/gather in hardware. Since not doing sg
    is such a big performance hit, we (optionally) bounce the requests
    to a simple linear buffer that we hand over to the driver.

So this runs the risk on reducing performance on simple MMC/SD
controllers. Notice: simple, not old.

We need to know if people are deploying simple controllers still
and if this is something that really affects their performance.

That said: this was put in place because the kernel was sending
SG lists that the host DMA could not manage.

Nowadays we have two mechanisms:

- DMA engine and DMA-API that help out in managing bounce
  buffers when used. This means this only is useful for hardware
  that does autonomous DMA, without any separate DMA engine.

- CMA that can actually allocate a big chunk of memory: I think
  this original code is restricted to a 64KB segment because
  kmalloc() will only guarantee contigous physical memory up to
  64-128KiB or so. Now we could actually allocate a big badass
  CMA buffer if that improves the performance, and that would be
  a per-host setting.

It would be good to hear from people seeing benefits from bounce
buffers about this. What hardware is there that acually sees a
significant improvement with bounce buffers?

Pierre, what host were you developing this for? Maybe I can try
to get the same and test it.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
