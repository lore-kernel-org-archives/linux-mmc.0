Well, when I say erase block, I really mean the "large unit", which is some
multiple of entire megabytes, because the only reasonable way to use this
is to define this to the size of the erase block or a very small multiple
of that. When detecting the "erase block size" of an eMMC, we should report
the smallest multiple of the ERASE_GPR_SIZE, HC_ERASE_GRP_SIZE and 
LARGE_UNIT_SIZE_M1.
