MQ is not better - it is just different.  Because mmc devices do not have
multiple hardware queues, blk-mq essentially offers nothing but a different
way of doing the same thing.  And there are problems, such as blk-mq assumes
that the primary arbiter of whether a request can be issued is the queue
depth.  As I wrote here:
  https://marc.info/?l=linux-mmc&m=148336571720463&w=2
that is not the case for mmc, even with command queuing.

Also I wouldn't be surprise if BFQ needs some changes to work well with
command queuing.

It would be better if blk-mq support was experimental until we can see how
well it works in practice.
