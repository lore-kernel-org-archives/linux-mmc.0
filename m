I'm willing to spend a little space overhead in return for one
or two orders of magnitude in performance and life expectancy
for the card ;-)

A typical case is that a single-page (16KB) write to the currently
open erase block takes 1ms, but since writing to another erase block
requires a garbage-collection (erase-rewrite 4 MB), it takes 500 ms,
just like the following access to the first erase block, which
has now been closed.

Every erase cycle ages the drive, and on some cheap ones, you only
have about 2000 guaranteed erases per erase block!

Is it just a performance/space tradeoff, or is there also a
performance overhead in this?

Ok, I should try to find out how this is done on SD cards.
The hardware interface allows erasing 512 byte sectors, so
we might be reporting that instead.

Ok. It was previously suggested to put an external journal on a
4 MB partition for experimenting with this. I hope I can back this
up with performance numbers soon.

For SDHC cards, the typical case is that they are reasonably efficient
when you use the reported size, because they are tested that way.
A lot of cards use 2MiB internally but report 4MiB, which is fine
as long as you write the 4MB consecutively and don't alternate
between the two halves.

The split into three erase blocks of (4 MiB / 3) is on low-end
SanDisk cards, and I believe it has mostly advantages and will
work well if we use the reported 4 MB.

The 4128 KiB erase blocks are on a USB stick, and those devices
do not report any erase block size at all.

I have written a tool to detect the actual erase block size,
and perhaps that could be integrated into mke2fs and similar
tools.
