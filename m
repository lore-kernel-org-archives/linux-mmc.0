The block layer cannot be a module, but the MMC layer can.

I think CONFIG_MMC should remain tristate. However, we could
consider making CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK a 'bool' symbol and
linking it into the mmc-core module when enabled.

I think the ext_csd is extremely useful on storage devices to have
exposed to user space in some form. There is a comment saying
that we don't store it in RAM at the moment as it is rarely used,
but we could change that, as it's only 512 bytes per eMMC device
and there is rarely more than one of them. IIRC, the ext_csd is
entirely readonly and doesn't change during runtime, so we
gain nothing by issuing the commands every time someone reads
the debugfs file.
