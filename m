On the second look it seems that there is no waiting for
the retried areq to complete so I cannot see what protects
us from racing and trying to run two areq-s in parallel:

1st areq being retried (in the completion kthread):

	mmc_blk_rw_done()->mmc_restart_areq()->__mmc_start_data_req()

2nd areq coming from the second request in the queue
(in the queuing kthread):

	mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq()->mmc_start_areq()->__mmc_start_data_req()

(after mmc_blk_rw_done() is done in mmc_finalize_areq() 1st
areq is marked as completed by the completion kthread and
the waiting on host->areq in mmc_start_areq() of the queuing
kthread is done and 2nd areq is started while the 1st one
is still being retried)

?

Also retrying of areqs for MMC_BLK_RETRY status case got broken
(before change do {} while() loop increased retry variable,
now the loop is gone and retry variable will not be increased
correctly and we can loop forever).
