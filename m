Great, thanks!

Thanks, and already taken care of.

Yes, I am up for that!

I have now also completed my review of the series and in the end, most
of my comments turned out to be of minor issues, hopefully easily
addressed.

I am awaiting a re-based v15 version - and eager to apply it! :-)

Thanks and kind regards
